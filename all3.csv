JAMES ORR,"The savage loves his native shore,
    Though rude the soil and chill the air;
  Then well may Erin's sons adore
    Their isle which nature formed so fair,
  What flood reflects a shore so sweet
    As Shannon great or pastoral Bann?
  Or who a friend or foe can meet
    So generous as an Irishman?

  His hand is rash, his heart is warm,
    But honesty is still his guide;
  None more repents a deed of harm,
    And none forgives with nobler pride;
  He may be duped, but won't be dared--
    More fit to practise than to plan;
  He dearly earns his poor reward,
    And spends it like an Irishman.

  If strange or poor, for you he'll pay,
    And guide to where you safe may be;
  If you're his guest, while e'er you stay,
    His cottage holds a jubilee.
  His inmost soul he will unlock,
    And if he may _your_ secrets scan,
  Your confidence he scorns to mock,
    For faithful is an Irishman.

  By honor bound in woe or weal,
    Whate'er she bids he dares to do;
  Try him with bribes--they won't prevail;
    Prove him in fire--you'll find him true.
  He seeks not safety, let his post
    Be where it ought in danger's van;
  And if the field of fame be lost,
    It won't be by an Irishman.

  Erin! loved land! from age to age,
    Be thou more great, more famed, and free,
  May peace be thine, or shouldst thou wage
    Defensive war, cheap victory.
  May plenty bloom in every field
    Which gentle breezes softly fan,
  And cheerful smiles serenely gild
    The home of every Irishman.

JOHN FRANCIS O'DONNELL,"My love to fight the Saxon goes,
        And bravely shines his sword of steel;
      A heron's feather decks his brows,
        And a spur on either heel;
      His steed is blacker than the sloe,
        And fleeter than the falling star;
      Amid the surging ranks he'll go
        And shout for joy of war.
  Twinkle, twinkle, pretty spindle; let the white wool drift and dwindle.
    Oh! we weave a damask doublet for my love's coat of steel.
  Hark! the timid, turning treadle crooning soft, old-fashioned ditties
    To the low, slow murmur of the brown round wheel.

      My love is pledged to Ireland's fight;
        My love would die for Ireland's weal,
      To win her back her ancient right,
        And make her foemen reel.
      Oh! close I'll clasp him to my breast
        When homeward from the war he comes;
      The fires shall light the mountain's crest,
        The valley peal with drums.
  Twinkle, twinkle, pretty spindle; let the white wool drift and dwindle.
    Oh! we weave a damask doublet for my love's coat of steel.
  Hark! the timid, turning treadle crooning soft old-fashioned ditties
    To the low, slow murmur of the brown round wheel.",A SPINNING SONG,WAR
MICHAEL JOSEPH BARRY," How little recks it where men lie,
    When once the moment's past
  In which the dim and glazing eye
    Has looked on earth its last,--
  Whether beneath the sculptured urn
    The coffined form shall rest,
  Or in its nakedness return
    Back to its mother's, breast!

  Death is a common friend or foe,
    As different men may hold,
  And at his summons each must go,
    The timid and the bold;
  But when the spirit, free and warm,
    Deserts it, as it must,
  What matter where the lifeless form
    Dissolves again to dust?

  The soldier falls 'mid corses piled
  Upon the battle-plain,
  Where reinless war-steeds gallop wild
    Above the mangled slain;
  But though his corse be grim to see,
    Hoof-trampled on the sod,
  What recks it, when the spirit free
    Has soared aloft to God?

  The coward's dying eyes may close
    Upon his downy bed,
  And softest hands his limbs compose,
    Or garments o'er them spread.
  But ye who shun the bloody fray,
    When fall the mangled brave,
  Go--strip his coffin-lid away,
    And see him in his grave!

  'Twere sweet, indeed, to close our eyes,
    With those we cherish near,
  And, wafted upwards by their sighs,
    Soar to some calmer sphere.
  But whether on the scaffold high,
    Or in the battle's van,
  The fittest place where man can die
    Is where he dies for man!",THE PLACE WHERE MAN SHOULD DIE,WAR
EDMUND SPENSER,"Lo I the man, whose Muse whilome did maske,
As time her taught in lowly Shepheards weeds,
Am now enforst a far unfitter taske,
For trumpets sterne to chaunge mine Oaten reeds,
And sing of Knights and Ladies gentle deeds;
Whose prayses having slept in silence long,
Me, all too meane, the sacred Muse areeds
To blazon broad emongst her learned throng:
Fierce warres and faithful loves shall moralize my song.
Helpe then, O holy Virgin chiefe of nine,
Thy weaker Novice to performe thy will,
Lay forth out of thine everlasting scryne
The antique rolles, which there lye hidden still,
Of Faerie knights and fairest Tanaquill,
Whom that most noble Briton Prince so long
Sought through the world, and suffered so much ill,
That I must rue his undeserved wrong:
O helpe thou my weake wit, and sharpen my dull tong.
And thou most dreaded impe of highest Jove,
Faire Venus sonne, that with thy cruell dart
At that good knight so cunningly didst rove,
That glorious fire it kindled in his hart,
Lay now thy deadly Heben bow apart,
And with thy mother milde come to mine ayde:
Come both, and with you bring triumphant Mart,
In loves and gentle jollities arrayd,
After his murdrous spoiles and bloudy rage allayd.
And with them eke, O Goddesse heavenly bright,
Mirrour of grace and Majestie divine,
Great Lady of the greatest Isle, whose light
Like Phoebus lampe throughout the world doth shine,
Shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne,
And raise my thoughts too humble and too vile,
To thinke of that true glorious type of thine,
The argument of mine afflicted stile:
The which to heare, vouchsafe, O dearest dred a-while.

i
A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine,
Y cladd in mightie armes and silver shielde,
Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine,
The cruell markes of many a bloudy fielde;
Yet armes till that time did he never wield:
His angry steede did chide his foming bitt,
As much disdayning to the curbe to yield:
Full jolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt,
As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt.

ii
But on his brest a bloudie Crosse he bore,
The deare remembrance of his dying Lord,
For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore,
And dead as living ever him ador'd:
Upon his shield the like was also scor'd,
For soveraine hope, which in his helpe he had:
Right faithfull true he was in deede and word,
But of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad;
Yet nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad.

iii
Upon a great adventure he was bond,
That greatest Gloriana to him gave,
That greatest Glorious Queene of Faerie lond,
To winne him worship, and her grace to have,
Which of all earthly things he most did crave;
And ever as he rode, his hart did earne
To prove his puissance in battell brave
Upon his foe, and his new force to learne;
Upon his foe, a Dragon horrible and stearne.

iv
A lovely Ladie rode him faire beside,
Upon a lowly Asse more white then snow,
Yet she much whiter, but the same did hide
Under a vele, that wimpled was full low,
And over all a blacke stole she did throw,
As one that inly mournd: so was she sad,
And heavie sat upon her palfrey slow;
Seemed in heart some hidden care she had,
And by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad.

v
So pure an innocent, as that same lambe,
She was in life and every vertuous lore,
And by descent from Royall lynage came
Of ancient Kings and Queenes, that had of yore
Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore,
And all the world in their subjection held;
Till that infernall feend with foule uprore
Forwasted all their land, and them expeld:
Whom to avenge, she had this Knight from far compeld.

vi
Behind her farre away a Dwarfe did lag,
That lasie seemd in being ever last,
Or wearied with bearing of her bag
Of needments at his backe. Thus as they past,
The day with cloudes was suddeine overcast,
And angry Jove an hideous storme of raine
Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast,
That every wight to shrowd it did constrain,
And this faire couple eke to shroud themselves were fain.

vii
Enforst to seeke some covert nigh at hand,
A shadie grove not far away they spide,
That promist ayde the tempest to withstand:
Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride,
Did spred so broad, that heavens light did hide,
Not perceable with power of any starre:
And all within were pathes and alleies wide,
With footing worne, and leading inward farre:
Faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre.

viii
And foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led,
Joying to heare the birdes sweete harmony,
Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred,
Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky.
Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy,
The sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and tall,
The vine-prop Elme, the Poplar never dry,
The builder Oake, sole king of forrests all,
The Aspine good for staves, the Cypresse funerall.

ix
The Laurell, meed of mightie Conquerours
And Poets sage, the Firre that weepeth still,
The Willow worne of forlorne Paramours,
The Eugh obedient to the benders will,
The Birch for shaftes, the Sallow for the mill,
The Mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound,
The warlike Beech, the Ash for nothing ill,
The fruitfull Olive, and the Platane round,
The carver Holme, the Maple seeldom inward sound.

x
Led with delight, they thus beguile the way,
Untill the blustring storme is overblowne;
When weening to returne, whence they did stray,
They cannot find that path, which first was showne,
But wander too and fro in wayes unknowne,
Furthest from end then, when they neerest weene,
That makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne:
So many pathes, so many turnings seene,
That which of them to take, in diverse doubt they been.

xi
At last resolving forward still to fare,
Till that some end they finde or in or out,
That path they take, that beaten seemd most bare,
And like to lead the labyrinth about;
Which when by tract they hunted had throughout,
At length it brought them to a hollow cave,
Amid the thickest woods. The Champion stout
Eftsoones dismounted from his courser brave,
And to the Dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gave.

xii
Be well aware, quoth then that Ladie milde,
Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash provoke:
The danger hid, the place unknowne and wilde,
Breeds dreadfull doubts: Oft fire is without smoke,
And perill without show: therefore your stroke
Sir knight with-hold, till further triall made.
Ah Ladie (said he) shame were to revoke
The forward footing for an hidden shade:
Vertue gives her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade.

xiii
Yea but (quoth she) the perill of this place
I better wot then you, though now too late
To wish you backe returne with foule disgrace,
Yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate,
To stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate.
This is the wandring wood, this Errours den,
A monster vile, whom God and man does hate:
Therefore I read beware. Fly fly (quoth then
The fearefull Dwarfe:) this is no place for living men.

xiv
But full of fire and greedy hardiment,
The youthfull knight could not for ought be staide,
But forth unto the darksome hole he went,
And looked in: his glistring armor made
A litle glooming light, much like a shade,
By which he saw the ugly monster plaine,
Halfe like a serpent horribly displaide,
But th'other halfe did womans shape retaine,
Most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine.

xv
And as she lay upon the durtie ground,
Her huge long taile her den all overspred,
Yet was in knots and many boughtes upwound,
Pointed with mortall sting. Of her there bred
A thousand yong ones, which she dayly fed,
Sucking upon her poisonous dugs, eachone
Of sundry shapes, yet all ill favored:
Soone as that uncouth light upon them shone,
Into her mouth they crept, and suddain all were gone.

xvi
Their dam upstart, out of her den effraide,
And rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile
About her cursed head, whose folds displaid
Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile.
She lookt about, and seeing one in mayle
Armed to point, sought backe to turne againe;
For light she hated as the deadly bale,
Ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine,
Where plaine none might her see, nor she see any plaine.

xvii
Which when the valiant Elfe perceiv'd, he lept
As Lyon fierce upon the flying pray,
And with his trenchand blade her boldly kept
From turning backe, and forced her to stay:
Therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray,
And turning fierce, her speckled taile advaunst,
Threatning her angry sting, him to dismay:
Who nought aghast, his mightie hand enhaunst:
The stroke down from her head unto her shoulder glaunst.

xviii
Much daunted with that dint, her sence was dazd,
Yet kindling rage, her selfe she gathered round,
And all attonce her beastly body raizd
With doubled forces high above the ground:
Tho wrapping up her wrethed sterne arownd,
Lept fierce upon his shield, and her huge traine
All suddenly about his body wound,
That hand or foot to stirre he strove in vaine:
God helpe the man so wrapt in Errours endlesse traine.

xix
His Lady sad to see his sore constraint,
Cride out, Now now Sir knight, shew what ye bee,
Add faith unto your force, and be not faint:
Strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee.
That when he heard, in great perplexitie,
His gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine,
And knitting all his force got one hand free,
Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine,
That soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine.

xx
Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw
A floud of poyson horrible and blacke,
Full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw,
Which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke
His grasping hold, and from her turne him backe:
Her vomit full of bookes and papers was,
With loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke,
And creeping sought way in the weedy gras:
Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has.

xxi
As when old father Nilus gins to swell
With timely pride above the Aegyptian vale,
His fattie waves do fertile slime outwell,
And overflow each plaine and lowly dale:
But when his later spring gins to avale,
Huge heapes of mudd he leaves, wherein there breed
Ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male
And partly female of his fruitfull seed;
Such ugly monstrous shapes elsewhere may no man reed.

xxii
The same so sore annoyed has the knight,
That welnigh choked with the deadly stinke,
His forces faile, ne can no longer fight.
Whose corage when the feend perceiv'd to shrinke,
She poured forth out of her hellish sinke
Her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small,
Deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke,
Which swarming all about his legs did crall,
And him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all.

xxiii
As gentle Shepheard in sweete even-tide,
When ruddy Phoebus gins to welke in west,
High on an hill, his flocke to vewen wide,
Markes which do byte their hasty supper best;
A cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest,
All striving to infixe their feeble stings,
That from their noyance he no where can rest,
But with his clownish hands their tender wings
He brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings.

xxiv
Thus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of shame,
Then of the certaine perill he stood in,
Halfe furious unto his foe he came,
Resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win,
Or soone to lose, before he once would lin;
And strooke at her with more then manly force,
That from her body full of filthie sin
He raft her hatefull head without remorse;
A streame of cole black bloud forth gushed from her corse.

xxv
Her scattred brood, soone as their Parent deare
They saw so rudely falling to the ground,
Groning full deadly, all with troublous feare,
Gathred themselves about her body round,
Weening their wonted entrance to have found
At her wide mouth: but being there withstood
They flocked all about her bleeding wound,
And sucked up their dying mothers blood,
Making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good.

xxvi
That detestable sight him much amazde,
To see th'unkindly Impes of heaven accurst,
Devoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd,
Having all satisfide their bloudy thurst,
Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst,
And bowels gushing forth: well worthy end
Of such as drunke her life, the which them nurst;
Now needeth him no lenger labour spend,
His foes have slaine themselves, with whom he should contend.

xxvii
His Ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from farre
Approcht in hast to greet his victorie,
And said, Faire knight, borne under happy starre,
Who see your vanquisht foes before you lye:
Well worthy be you of that Armorie,
Wherein ye have great glory wonne this day,
And proov'd your strength on a strong enimie,
Your first adventure: many such I pray,
And henceforth ever wish, that like succeed it may.

xxviii
Then mounted he upon his Steede againe,
And with the Lady backward sought to wend;
That path he kept, which beaten was most plame,
Ne ever would to any by-way bend,
But still did follow one unto the end,
The which at last out of the wood them brought.
So forward on his way (with God to frend)
He passed forth, and new adventure sought;
Long way he travelled, before he heard of ought.

xxix
At length they chaunst to meet upon the way
An aged Sire, in long blacke weedes yclad,
His feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray,
And by his belt his booke he hanging had;
Sober he seemde, and very sagely sad,
And to the ground his eyes were lowly bent,
Simple in shew, and voyde of malice bad,
And all the way he prayed, as he went,
And often knockt his brest, as one that did repent.

xxx
He faire the knight saluted, louting low,
Who faire him quited, as that courteous was:
And after asked him, if he did know
Of straunge adventures, which abroad did pas.
Ah my deare Sonne (quoth he) how should, alas,
Silly old man, that lives in hidden cell,
Bidding his beades all day for his trespas,
Tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell?
With holy father sits not with such things to mell.

xxxi
But if of daunger which hereby doth dwell,
And homebred evill ye desire to heare,
Of a straunge man I can you tidings tell,
That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare.
Of such (said he) I chiefly do inquere,
And shall you well reward to shew the place,
In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare:
For to all knighthood it is foule disgrace,
That such a cursed creature lives so long a space.

xxxii
Far hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse
His dwelling is, by which no living wight
May ever passe, but thorough great distresse.
Now (sayd the Lady) draweth toward night,
And well I wote, that of your later fight
Ye all forwearied be: for what so strong,
But wanting rest will also want of might?
The Sunne that measures heaven all day long,
At night doth baite his steedes the Ocean waves emong.

xxxiii
Then with the Sunne take Sir, your timely rest,
And with new day new worke at once begin:
Untroubled night they say gives counsell best.
Right well Sir knight ye have advised bin,
(Quoth then that aged man;) the way to win
Is wisely to advise: now day is spent;
Therefore with me ye may take up your In
For this same night. The knight was well content:
So with that godly father to his home they went.

xxxiv
A little lowly Hermitage it was,
Downe in a dale, hard by a forests side,
Far from resort of people, that did pas
In travell to and froe: a little wyde
There was an holy Chappell edifyde,
Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to say
His holy things each morne and eventyde:
Thereby a Christall streame did gently play,
Which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway.

xxxv
Arrived there, the little house they fill,
Ne looke for entertainement, where none was:
Rest is their feast, and all things at their will;
The noblest mind the best contentment has.
With faire discourse the evening so they pas:
For that old man of pleasing wordes had store,
And well could file his tongue as smooth as glas;
He told of Saintes and Popes, and evermore
He strowd an Ave-Mary after and before.

xxxvi
The drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast,
And the sad humour loading their eye liddes,
As messenger of Morpheus on them cast
Sweet slombring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes.
Unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes:
Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes,
He to his study goes, and there amiddes
His Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes,
He seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes.

xxxvii
Then choosing out few wordes most horrible,
(Let none them read) thereof did verses frame,
With which and other spelles like terrible,
He bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly Dame,
And cursed heaven, and spake reprochfull shame
Of highest God, the Lord of life and light;
A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name
Great Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night,
At which Cocytus quakes, and Styx is put to flight.

xxxviii
And forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred
Legions of Sprights, the which like little flyes
Fluttring about his ever damned hed,
A-waite whereto their service he applyes,
To aide his friends, or fray his enimies:
Of those he chose out two, the falsest twoo,
And fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes;
The one of them he gave a message too,
The other by him selfe staide other worke to doo.

xxxix
He making speedy way through spersed ayre,
And through the world of waters wide and peepe,
To Morpheus house doth hastily repaire.
Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe,
And low, where dawning day doth never peepe,
His dwelling is; there Tethys his wet bed
Doth ever wash, and Cynthia still doth steepe
In silver deaw his ever-drouping hed,
Whiles sad Night over him her mantle black doth spred.

xl
Whose double gates he findeth locked fast,
The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yvory,
The other all with silver overcast;
And wakefull dogges before them farre do lye
Watching to banish Care their enimy,
Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe.
By them the Sprite doth passe in quietly,
And unto Morpheus comes, whom drowned deepe
In drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe.

xli
And more, to lulle him in his slumber soft,
A trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe
And ever-drizling raine upon the loft,
Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne
Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne:
No other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes,
As still are wont t'annoy the walled towne,
Might there be heard: but carelesse Quiet lyes,
Wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes.

xlii
The messenger approching to him spake,
But his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine:
So sound he slept, that nought mought him awake.
Then rudely he him thrust, and pusht with paine,
Whereat he gan to stretch: but he againe
Shooke him so hard, that forced him to speake.
As one then in a dreame, whose dryer braine
In tost with troubled sights and fancies weake,
He mumbled soft, but would not all his silence breake.

xliii
The Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake,
And threatned unto him the dreaded name
Of Hecate: whereat he gan to quake,
And lifting up his lumpish head, with blame
Halfe angry asked him, for what he came.
Hither (quoth he) me Archimago sent,
He that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame,
He bids thee to him send for his intent
A fit false dreame, that can delude the sleepers sent.

xliv
The God obayde, and calling forth straight way
A diverse dreame out of his prison darke,
Delivered it to him, and downe did lay
His heavie head, devoide of carefull carke,
Whose sences all were straight benumbed and starke.
He backe returning by the Yvorie dore,
Remounted up as light as chearefull Larke,
And on his litle winges the dreame he bore
In hast unto his Lord, where he him left afore.

xlv
Who all this while with charmes and hidden artes,
Had made a Lady of that other Spright,
And fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes
So lively, and so like in all mens sight,
That weaker sence it could have ravisht quight:
The maker selfe for all his wondrous witt,
Was nigh beguiled with so goodly sight:
Her all in white he clad, and over it
Cast a blacke stole, most like to seeme for Una fit.

xlvi
Now when that ydle dreame was to him brought,
Unto that Elfin knight he bad him fly,
Where he slept soundly void of evill thought
And with false shewes abuse his fantasy,
In sort as he him schooled privily:
And that new creature borne without her dew,
Full of the makers guile, with usage sly
He taught to imitate that Lady trew,
Whose semblance she did carrie under feigned hew.

xlvii
Thus well instructed, to their worke they hast,
And comming where the knight in slomber lay,
The one upon his hardy head him plast,
And made him dreame of loves and lustfull play,
That nigh his manly hart did melt away,
Bathed in wanton blis and wicked joy:
Then seemed him his Lady by him lay,
And to him playnd, how that false winged boy,
Her chast hart had subdewd, to learne Dame pleasures toy.

xlviii
And she her selfe of beautie soveraigne Queene,
Faire Venus seemde unto his bed to bring
Her, whom he waking evermore did weene,
To be the chastest flowre, that ay did spring
On earthly braunch, the daughter of a king,
Now a loose Leman to vile service bound:
And eke the Graces seemed all to sing,
Hymen {i}{_o} Hymen, dauncing all around,
While freshest Flora her with Yvie girlond crownd.

xlix
In this great passion of unwonted lust,
Or wonted feare of doing ought amis,
He started up, as seeming to mistrust
Some secret ill, or hidden foe of his:
Lo there before his face his Lady is,
Under blake stole hyding her bayted hooke,
And as halfe blushing offred him to kis,
With gentle blandishment and lovely looke,
Most like that virgin true, which for her knight him took.

l
All cleane dismayd to see so uncouth sight,
And halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise,
He thought have slaine her in his fierce despight:
But hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise,

Where cause is none, but to your rest depart.
Not all content, yet seemd she to appease
Her mournefull plaintes, beguiled of her art,
And fed with words, that could not chuse but please,
So slyding softly forth, she turnd as to her ease.

Much griev'd to think that gentle Dame so light,
For whose defence he was to shed his blood.

Having yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright,
That troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine,
With bowres, and beds, and Ladies deare delight:

With that misformed spright he backe returnd againe.","from The Faerie Queene: Book I, Canto I",WAR
JOSEPH RODMAN DRAKE,"When Freedom, from her mountain height,
    Unfurled her standard to the air,
  She tore the azure robe of night,
    And set the stars of glory there!
  She mingled with its gorgeous dyes
  The milky baldric of the skies,
  And striped its pure, celestial white
  With streakings of the morning light;
  Then, from his mansion in the sun,
  She called her eagle-bearer down,
  And gave into his mighty hand
  The symbol of her chosen land!

  Majestic monarch of the cloud!
    Who rear'st aloft thy regal form,
  To hear the tempest trumping loud,
  And see the lightning lances driven,
    When strive the warriors of the storm,
  And rolls the thunder-drum of heaven,--
  Child of the Sun! to thee 'tis given
    To guard the banner of the free,
  To hover in the sulphur smoke,
  To ward away the battle-stroke,
  And bid its blendings shine afar,
  Like rainbows on the cloud of war,
    The harbingers of victory!

  Flag of the brave! thy folds shall fly,
  The sign of hope and triumph high!
  When speaks the signal-trumpet tone,
  And the long line comes gleaming on,
  Ere yet the life-blood, warm and wet,
  Has dimmed the glistening bayonet,
  Each soldier's eye shall brightly turn
  To where thy sky-born glories burn,
  And, as his springing steps advance,
  Catch war and vengeance from the glance.

  And when the cannon-mouthings loud
  Heave in wild wreaths the battle shroud,
  And gory sabres rise and fall
  Like shoots of flame on midnight's pall,
  Then shall thy meteor glances glow,
    And cowering foes shall shrink beneath
  Each gallant arm that strikes below
    That lovely messenger of death.

  Flag of the seas! on ocean wave
  Thy stars shall glitter o'er the brave;
  When death, careering on the gale,
  Sweeps darkly round the bellied sail,
  And frighted waves rush wildly back
  Before the broadside's reeling rack,
  Each dying wanderer of the sea
  Shall look at once to heaven and thee,
  And smile to see thy splendors fly
  In triumph o'er his closing eye.

  Flag of the free heart's hope and home,
    By angel hands to valor given!
  Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,
    And all thy hues were born in heaven.
  Forever float that standard sheet!
  Where breathes the foe but falls before us,
  With Freedom's soil beneath our feet,
    And Freedom's banner streaming o'er us!
",THE AMERICAN FLAG,WAR
FRANCIS SCOTT KEY," O, say, can you see by the dawn's early light
  What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?--
  Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the clouds of the fight
  O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming!
  And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
  Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
  O! say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
  O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?

  On that shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
  Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
  What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
  As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses?
  Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
  In full glory reflected now shines on the stream;
  'Tis the star-spangled banner! O, long may it wave
  O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!

  And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
  That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
  A home and a country should leave us no more?
  Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
  No refuge could save the hireling and slave
  From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave;
  And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
  O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!

  O! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
  Between their loved homes and the war's desolation!
  Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heaven-rescued land
  Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
  Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,

THE VICTOR,"Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power
  Which God hath in his mighty angels placed!)
  Their arms away threw, and to the hills
  (For earth hath this variety from heaven,
  Of pleasures situate in hill and dale),
  Light as the lightning glimpse they ran, they flew,
  From their foundations loosening to and fro,
  They plucked the seated hills, with all their load,
  Rocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggy tops
  Uplifting bore them in their hands: amaze,
  Be sure, and terror, seized the rebel host,
  When coming towards them so dread they saw
  The bottom of the mountains upward turned,
   .      .      .      .  and on their heads
  Main promontories flung, which in the air
  Came shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed;
  Their armor helped their harm, crushed in and bruised
  Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain
  Implacable, and many a dolorous groan;
  Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind
  Out of such prison, though spirits of purest light,
  Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.
  The rest, in imitation, to like arms
  Betook them, and the neighboring hills uptore:
  So hills amid the air encountered hills,
  Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire,
  That underground they fought in dismal shade;
  Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game
  To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped
  Upon confusion rose.
",THE CONFLICT,WAR
CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE,"TAMBURLAINE.--But now, my boys, leave off and list to me,
  That mean to teach you rudiments of war:
  I'll have you learn to sleep upon the ground,
  March in your armor through watery fens,
  Sustain the scorching heat and freezing cold,
  Hunger and thirst, right adjuncts of the war,
  And after this to scale a castle wall,
  Besiege a fort, to undermine a town,
  And make whole cities caper in the air.
  Then next the way to fortify your men:
  In champion grounds, what figure serves you best,
  For which the quinque-angle form is meet,
  Because the corners there may fall more flat
  Whereas the fort may fittest be assailed,
  And sharpest where the assault is desperate.
  The ditches must be deep; the counterscarps
  Narrow and steep; the walls made high and broad;
  The bulwarks and the rampires large and strong,
  With cavalieros and thick counterforts,
  And room within to lodge six thousand men.
  It must have privy ditches, countermines,
  And secret issuings to defend the ditch;
  It must have high argins and covered ways,
  To keep the bulwark fronts from battery,
  And parapets to hide the musketers;
  Casemates to place the great artillery;
  And store of ordnance, that from every flank
  May scour the outward curtains of the fort,
  Dismount the cannon of the adverse part,
  Murder the foe, and save the walls from breach.
  When this is learned for service on the land,
  By plain and easy demonstration
  I'll teach you how to make the water mount,
  That you may dry-foot march through lakes and pools,
  Deep rivers, havens, creeks, and little seas,
  And make a fortress in the raging waves,
  Fenced with the concave of monstrous rock,
  Invincible by nature of the place.
  When this is done then are ye soldiers,
  And worthy sons of Tamburlaine the Great.

  CALYPHAS.--My lord, but this is dangerous to be done:
  We may be slain or wounded ere we learn.

  TAMBURLAINE.--Villain! Art thou the son of Tamburlaine,
  And fear'st to die, or with a curtle-axe
  To hew thy flesh, and make a gaping wound?
  Hast thou beheld a peal of ordnance strike
  A ring of pikes, mingled with shot and horse,
  Whose shattered limbs, being tossed as high as Heaven,
  Hang in the air as thick as sunny motes,
  And canst thou, coward, stand in fear of death?
  Hast thou not seen my horsemen charge the foe,
  Shot through the arms, cut overthwart the hands,
  Dyeing their lances with their streaming blood,
  And yet at night carouse within my tent,
  Filling their empty veins with airy wine,
  That, being concocted, turns to crimson blood.--
  And wilt thou shun the field for fear of wounds?
  View me, thy father, that hath conquered kings,
  And with his horse marched round about the earth
  Quite void of scars and clear from any wound,
  That by the wars lost not a drop of blood,--
  And see him lance his flesh to teach you all.
            (_He cuts his arm._)
  A wound is nothing, be it ne'er so deep;
  Blood is the god of war's rich livery,
  Now look I like a soldier, and this wound
  As great a grace and majesty to me,
  As if a chain of gold, enamellèd,
  Enchased with diamonds, sapphires, rubies,
  And fairest pearl of wealthy India,
  Were mounted here under a canopy,
  And I sate down clothed with a massy robe,
  That late adorned the Afric potentate,
  Whom I brought bound unto Damascus' walls.
  Come, boys, and with your fingers search my wound,
  And in my blood wash all your hands at once,
  While I sit smiling to behold the sight.
  Now, my boys, what think ye of a wound?

  CALYPHAS.--I know not what I should think of it; methinks it is a
          pitiful sight.

  CELEBINUS.--'Tis nothing: give me a wound, father.

  AMYRAS.--And me another, my lord.

  TAMBURLAINE.--Come, sirrah, give me your arm.

  CELEBINUS.--Here, father, cut it bravely, as you did your own.

  TAMBURLAINE.--It shall suffice thou darest abide a wound:
  My boy, thou shalt not lose a drop of blood
  Before we meet the army of the Turk;
  But then run desperate through the thickest throngs,
  Dreadless of blows, of bloody wounds, and death;
  And let the burning of Larissa-walls,

  No; let us rise at once, gird on our swords,

  Of his thronged legions, and charge home upon him.
  Perhaps some arm, more lucky than the rest,
  May reach his heart, and free the world from bondage.
  Rise! Fathers, rise! 'tis Rome demands your help:
  Rise, and revenge her slaughtered citizens,

GEORGE CROLY,"It was the wild midnight,--
    A storm was on the sky;
  The lightning gave its light,
    And the thunder echoed by.

  The torrent swept the glen,
    The ocean lashed the shore;
  Then rose the Spartan men,
    To make their bed in gore!

  Swift from the deluge ground
    Three hundred took the shield;
  Then, silent, gathered round
    The leader of the field!

  He spake no warrior word,
    He bade no trumpet blow,
  But the signal thunder roared,
    And they rushed upon the foe.

  The fiery element
    Showed, with one mighty gleam,
  Rampart, and flag, and tent,
    Like the spectres of a dream.

  All up the mountain's side,
    All down the woody vale,
  All by the rolling tide
    Waved the Persian banners pale.

  And foremost from the pass,
    Among the slumbering band,
  Sprang King Leonidas,
    Like the lightning's living brand.

  Then double darkness fell,
    And the forest ceased its moan;
  But there came a clash of steel,
    And a distant dying groan.

  Anon, a trumpet blew,
    And a fiery sheet burst high,
  That o'er the midnight threw
    A blood-red canopy.

  A host glared on the hill;
    A host glared by the bay;
  But the Greeks rushed onward still,
    Like leopards in their play.

  The air was all a yell,
    And the earth was all a flame,
  Where the Spartan's bloody steel
    On the silken turbans came;

  And still the Greek rushed on
    Where the fiery torrent rolled,
  Till like a rising sun
    Shone Xerxes' tent of gold.

  They found a royal feast,
    His midnight banquet, there;
  And the treasures of the East
    Lay beneath the Doric spear.

  Then sat to the repast
    The bravest of the brave!
  That feast must be their last,
    That spot must be their grave.

  They pledged old Sparta's name
    In cups of Syrian wine,
  And the warrior's deathless fame
    Was sung in strains divine.

  They took the rose-wreathed lyres
    From eunuch and from slave,
  And taught the languid wires,
    The sounds that Freedom gave.

  But now the morning star
    Crowned Oeta's twilight brow;
  And the Persian horn of war
    From the hills began to blow.

  Up rose the glorious rank,
    To Greece one cup poured high,
  Then hand in hand they drank,
    ""To immortality!""

  Fear on King Xerxes fell,
    When, like spirits from the tomb,
  With shout and trumpet knell,
    He saw the warriors come.

  But down swept all his power,
    With chariot and with charge;
  Down poured the arrows' shower.
    Till sank the Dorian's targe.

  They gathered round the tent,
    With all their strength unstrung;
  To Greece one look they sent,
    Then on high their torches flung.

  The king sat on the throne,
    His captains by his side,
  While the flame rushed roaring on,
    And their Paean loud replied.

  Commanding fires of death to light
  The darkness of her scenery.

  By torch and trumpet fast arrayed,
  Each horseman drew his battle-blade,
  And furious every charger neighed,

  Hurrah! hurrah! a single field hath turned the chance of war!
  Hurrah! hurrah! for Ivry, and Henry of Navarre.

  Oh! how our hearts were beating, when, at the dawn of day,
  We saw the army of the League drawn out in long array;
  With all its priest-led citizens, and all its rebel peers,
  And Appenzel's stout infantry, and Egmont's Flemish spears.
  There rode the brood of false Lorraine, the curses of our land;
  And dark Mayenne was in the midst, a truncheon in his hand;
  An as we looked on them, we thought of Seine's empurpled flood,
  And good Coligni's hoary hair all dabbled with his blood;
  And we cried unto the living God, who rules the fate of war,
  To fight for His own holy name, and Henry of Navarre.

  The king has come to marshal us, in all his armor drest;
  And he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant crest.
  He looked upon his people, and a tear was in his eye;
  He looked upon the traitors, and his glance was stern and high.
  Right graciously he smiled on us, as rolled from wing to wing,
  Down all our line, a deafening shout: God save our lord the king!

  A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest.
  A thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest;
  And in they burst, and on they rushed, while, like a guiding star,
  Amidst the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of Navarre.

  Now, God be praised, the day is ours: Mayenne hath turned his rein;
  D'Aumale hath cried for quarter; the Flemish count is slain;
  Their ranks are breaking like thin clouds before a Biscay gale;
  The field is heaped with bleeding steeds, and flags, and cloven mail.
  And then we thought on vengeance, and, all along our van,
  Remember Saint Bartholomew! was passed from man to man.
  But out spake gentle Henry--""No Frenchmen is my foe:
  Down, down, with every foreigner, but let your brethren go.""
  Oh! was there ever such a knight, in friendship or in war,

  The host was idly spread,
  The Danes around their watchfires met,
  Caroused, and fiercely fed.

  The chiefs beneath a tent of leaves
  And Guthrum, king of all,
  Devoured the flesh of England's beeves,
  And laughed at England's fall.
  Each warrior proud, each Danish earl,
  In mail of wolf-skin clad,
  Their bracelets white with plundered pearl,
  Their eyes with triumph mad.

  From Humber-land to Severn-land,
  And on to Tamar stream,
  Where Thames makes green the towery strand,
  Where Medway's waters gleam,--
  With hands of steel and mouths of flame
  They raged the kingdom through;
  And where the Norseman sickle came,
  No crop but hunger grew.

  They loaded many an English horse
  With wealth of cities fair;
  They dragged from many a father's corse
  The daughter by her hair.
  And English slaves, and gems and gold,
  Were gathered round the feast;
  Till midnight in their woodland hold,
  O, never that riot ceased.

  In stalked a warrior tall and rude
  Before the strong sea-kings;
  ""Ye Lords and Earls of Odin's brood,
  Without a harper sings.
  He seems a simple man and poor,
  But well he sounds the lay;
  And well, ye Norseman chiefs, be sure,
  Will ye the song repay.""

  In trod the bard with keen cold look,
  And glanced along the board,
  That with the shout and war-cry shook
  Of many a Danish lord.
  But thirty brows, inflamed and stern,
  Soon bent on him their gaze,
  While calm he gazed, as if to learn
  Who chief deserved his praise.

  Loud Guthrum spake,--""Nay, gaze not thus,
  Thou Harper weak and poor!
  By Thor! who bandy looks with us
  Must worse than looks endure.
  Sing high the praise of Denmark's host,
  High praise each dauntless Earl;
  The brave who stun this English coast
  With war's unceasing whirl.""

  The Harper slowly bent his head,
  And touched aloud the string;
  Then raised his face, and boldly said,
  ""Hear thou my lay, O King!
  High praise from every mouth of man
  To all who boldly strive,
  Who fall where first the fight began,
  And ne'er go back alive.

  ""Fill high your cups, and swell the shout,
  At famous Regnar's name!
  Who sank his host in bloody rout,
  When he to Humber came.
  His men were chased, his sons were slain,
  And he was left alone.
  They bound him in an iron chain
  Upon a dungeon stone.

  ""With iron links they bound him fast;
  With snakes they filled the hole,
  That made his flesh their long repast,
  And bit into his soul.

  ""Great chiefs, why sink in gloom your eyes?
  Why champ your teeth in pain?
  Still lives the song though Regnar dies!
  Fill high your cups again!
  Ye too, perchance, O Norseman lords!
  Who fought and swayed so long,
  Shall soon but live in minstrel words,
  And owe your names to song.

  ""This land has graves by thousands more
  Than that where Regnar lies.
  When conquests fade, and rule is o'er,
  The sod must close your eyes.
  How soon, who knows? Not chief, nor bard;
  And yet to me 'tis given,
  To see your foreheads deeply scarred,
  And guess the doom of Heaven.

  ""I may not read or when or how,
  But, Earls and Kings, be sure
  I see a blade o'er every brow,
  Where pride now sits secure.
  Fill high the cups, raise loud the strain!
  When chief and monarch fall,
  Their names in song shall breathe again,
  And thrill the feastful hall.""

  Grim sat the chiefs; one heaved a groan,
  And one grew pale with dread,
  His iron mace was grasped by one,
  By one his wine was shed.
  And Guthrum cried, ""Nay, bard, no more
  We hear thy boding lay;
  Make drunk the song with spoil and gore!
  Light up the joyous fray!""
  ""Quick throbs my brain,""--so burst the song,--
  To hear the strife once more.
  The mace, the axe, they rest too long;
  Earth cries, My thirst is sore.
  More blithely twang the strings of bows
  Than strings of harps in glee;
  Red wounds are lovelier than the rose
  Or rosy lips to me.

  ""O, fairer than a field of flowers,
  When flowers in England grew,
  Would be the battle's marshalled powers,
  The plain of carnage new.
  With all its death before my soul
  The vision rises fair;
  Raise loud the song, and drain the bowl!
  I would that I were there!""

  Loud rang the harp, the minstrel's eye
  Rolled fiercely round the throng;
  It seemed two crashing hosts were nigh,
  Whose shock aroused the song.
  A golden cup King Guthrum gave
  To him who strongly played;
  And said, ""I won it from the slave
  Who once o'er England swayed.""

  King Guthrum cried, ""'Twas Alfred's own;
  Thy song befits the brave:
  The King who cannot guard his throne
  Nor wine nor song shall have.""
  The minstrel took the goblet bright,
  And said, ""I drink the wine
  To him who owns by justest right
  The cup thou bid'st be mine.
  To him, your Lord, O shout ye all!
  His meed be deathless praise!
  The King who dares not nobly fall,
  Dies basely all his days.""

  ""The praise thou speakest,"" Guthrum said,
  ""With sweetness fills mine ear;
  For Alfred swift before me fled,
  And left me monarch here.
  The royal coward never dared
  Beneath mine eye to stand.
  O, would that now this feast he shared,
  And saw me rule his land!""

  Then stern the minstrel rose, and spake,
  And gazed upon the King,--
  ""Not now the golden cup I take,
  Nor more to thee I sing.
  Another day, a happier hour,
  Shall bring me here again:
  The cup shall stay in Guthrum's power,
  Till I demand it then.""

  The Harper turned and left the shed,
  Nor bent to Guthrum's crown;
  And one who marked his visage said
  It wore a ghastly frown.
  The Danes ne'er saw that Harper more,
  For soon as morning rose,
  Upon their camp King Alfred bore,
  And slew ten thousand foes.",ALFRED THE HARPER.,WAR

"THOMAS BABINGTON, LORD MACAULAY"," O, wherefore come ye forth, in triumph from the north,
  With your hands and your feet and your raiment all red?
  And wherefore doth your rout send forth a joyous shout?
  And whence be the grapes of the wine-press that ye tread?

  O, evil was the root, and bitter was the fruit,
  And crimson was the juice of the vintage that we trod:
  For we trampled on the throng of the haughty and the strong,
  Who sate in the high places and slew the saints of God.

  It was about the noon of a glorious day of June,
  That we saw their banners dance and their cuirasses shine,
  And the man of blood was there, with his long essenced hair,
  And Astley, and Sir Marmaduke, and Rupert of the Rhine.

  Like a servant of the Lord, with his Bible and his sword,
  The General rode along us to form us to the fight;
  When a murmuring sound broke out, and swelled into a shout
  Among the godless horsemen upon the tyrant's right.

  And hark! like the roar of the billows on the shore,
  The cry of battle rises along their charging line!
  For God! for the cause!--for the Church! for the laws!
  For Charles, king of England, and Rupert of the Rhine!

  The furious German comes, with his clarions and his drums,
  His bravoes of Alsatia, and pages of Whitehall;
  They are bursting on our flanks. Grasp your pikes! Close your ranks!
  For Rupert never comes but to conquer, or to fall.

  They are here! They rush on! We are broken! We are gone!
  Our left is borne before them like stubble on the blast.
  O Lord, put forth thy might! O Lord, defend the right!
  Stand back to back, in God's name! and fight it to the last!

  Stout Skippon hath a wound; the centre hath given ground:
  Hark! hark! what means the trampling of horsemen on our rear?
  Whose banner do I see, boys? 'Tis he! thank God! 'tis he, boys!
  Bear up another minute! Brave Oliver is here.

  Their heads all stooping low, their points all in a row,
  Like a whirlwind on the trees, like a deluge on the dikes,
  Our cuirassiers have burst on the ranks of the Accurst,
  And at a shock have scattered the forest of his pikes.

  Fast, fast the gallants ride, in some safe nook to hide
  Their coward heads, predestined to rot on Temple Bar;
  And he,--he turns, he flies:--shame on those cruel eyes
  That bore to look on torture, and dare not look on war!

  Ho! comrades, scour the plain; and, ere ye strip the slain,
  First give another stab to make your search secure;
  Then shake from sleeves and pockets their broadpieces and lockets,
  The tokens of the wanton, the plunder of the poor.

  Fools! your doublets shone with gold, and your hearts were gay and bold,
  When you kissed your lily hands to your lemans to-day;
  And to-morrow shall the fox, from her chambers in the rocks,
  Lead forth her tawny cubs to howl above the prey.

  Where be your tongues that late mocked at heaven and hell and fate?
  And the fingers that once were so busy with your blades,
  Your perfumed satin clothes, your catches and your oaths!
  Your stage-plays and your sonnets, your diamonds and your spades?

  Down! down! forever down, with the mitre and the crown!
  With the Belial of the court, and the Mammon of the Pope!
  There is woe in Oxford halls; there is wail in Durham's stalls;
  The Jesuit smites his bosom; the bishop rends his cope.

  And she of the seven hills shall mourn her children's ills,
  And tremble when she thinks on the edge of England's sword;
  And the kings of earth in fear shall shudder when they hear
  What the hand of God hath wrought for the Houses and the Word!","Y OBADIAH BIND-THEIR-KINGS-IN-CHAINS-AND-THEIR-NOBLES-WITH-

THOMAS CAMPBELL,"Of Nelson and the north
    Sing the glorious day's renown,
  When to battle fierce came forth
    All the might of Denmark's crown,
  And her arms along the deep proudly shone;
    By each gun the lighted brand
    In a bold determined hand,
    And the prince of all the land
  Led them on.

  Like leviathans afloat
    Lay their bulwarks on the brine;
  While the sign of battle flew
    On the lofty British line--
  It was ten of April morn by the chime.
    As they drifted on their path
    There was silence deep as death;
    And the boldest held his breath
  For a time.

  But the might of England flushed
    To anticipate the scene;
  And her van the fleeter rushed
    O'er the deadly space between.
  ""Hearts of oak!"" our captain cried; when each gun
    From its adamantine lips
    Spread a death-shade round the ships,
    Like the hurricane eclipse
  Of the sun.

  Again! again! again!
    And the havoc did not slack,
  Till a feeble cheer the Dane
    To our cheering sent us back;
  Their shots along the deep slowly boom--
    Then ceased--and all is wail,
    As they strike the shattered sail,
    Or in conflagration pale,
  Light the gloom.

  Out spoke the victor then,
    As he hailed them o'er the wave:
  ""Ye are brothers! ye are men!
    And we conquer but to save;
  So peace instead of death let us bring;
    But yield, proud foe, thy fleet,
    With the crews, at England's feet,
    And make submission meet
  To our king.""

  Then Denmark blessed our chief,
    That he gave her wounds repose;
  And the sounds of joy and grief
    From her people wildly rose,
  As death withdrew his shades from the day.
    While the sun looked smiling bright
    O'er a wide and woful sight,
    Where the fires of funeral light
  Died away.

  Now joy, old England, raise!
    For the tidings of thy might,
  By the festal cities' blaze,
    Whilst the wine-cup shines in light;
  And yet, amidst that joy and uproar,
    Let us think of them that sleep
    Full many a fathom deep,
    By thy wild and stormy steep,
  Elsinore!

  Brave hearts! to Britain's pride
    Once so faithful and so true,
  On the deck of fame that died,
    With the gallant good Riou--
  Soft sigh the winds of heaven o'er their grave!

CHARLES WOLFE,"Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,
    As his corse to the rampart we hurried;
  Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
    O'er the grave where our hero we buried.

  We buried him darkly, at dead of night,
    The sods with our bayonets turning;
  By the struggling moonbeams' misty light,
    And the lanthorn dimly burning.

  No useless coffin enclosed his breast,
    Not in sheet or in shroud we wound him;
  But he lay, like a warrior taking his rest,
    With his martial cloak around him.

  Few and short were the prayers we said,
    And we spoke not a word of sorrow;
  But we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead,
    And we bitterly thought of the morrow.

  We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed,
    And smoothed down his lonely pillow.
  That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head,
    And we far away on the billow!

  Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone,
    And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him,
  But little he'll reck, if they let him sleep on
    In the grave where a Briton has laid him!

  But half of our heavy task was done,
    When the clock struck the hour for retiring;
  And we heard the distant and random gun
    That the foe was sullenly firing.

  Slowly and sadly we laid him down,
    From the field of his fame fresh and gory;

A stupid calm, but nothing it, doth 'suage.
The fable is inverted, and far more
A block afflicts, now, than a stork before.
Storms chafe, and soon wear out themselves, or us;
In calms, Heaven laughs to see us languish thus.
As steady'as I can wish that my thoughts were,
Smooth as thy mistress' glass, or what shines there,
The sea is now; and, as the isles which we
Seek, when we can move, our ships rooted be.
As water did in storms, now pitch runs out;
As lead, when a fir'd church becomes one spout.
And all our beauty, and our trim, decays,
Like courts removing, or like ended plays.
The fighting-place now seamen's rags supply;
And all the tackling is a frippery.
No use of lanthorns; and in one place lay
Feathers and dust, to-day and yesterday.
Earth's hollownesses, which the world's lungs are,
Have no more wind than the upper vault of air.
We can nor lost friends nor sought foes recover,
But meteor-like, save that we move not, hover.
Only the calenture together draws
Dear friends, which meet dead in great fishes' jaws;
And on the hatches, as on altars, lies
Each one, his own priest, and own sacrifice.
Who live, that miracle do multiply,
Where walkers in hot ovens do not die.
If in despite of these we swim, that hath
No more refreshing than our brimstone bath;
But from the sea into the ship we turn,
Like parboil'd wretches, on the coals to burn.
Like Bajazet encag'd, the shepherds' scoff,
Or like slack-sinew'd Samson, his hair off,
Languish our ships. Now as a myriad
Of ants durst th' emperor's lov'd snake invade,
The crawling gallies, sea-gaols, finny chips,
Might brave our pinnaces, now bed-rid ships.
Whether a rotten state, and hope of gain,
Or to disuse me from the queasy pain
Of being belov'd and loving, or the thirst
Of honour, or fair death, out-push'd me first,
I lose my end; for here, as well as I,
A desperate may live, and a coward die.
Stag, dog, and all which from or towards flies,
Is paid with life or prey, or doing dies.
Fate grudges us all, and doth subtly lay
A scourge, 'gainst which we all forget to pray.
He that at sea prays for more wind, as well
Under the poles may beg cold, heat in hell.
What are we then? How little more, alas,
Is man now, than before he was? He was

I should not then thus feel this misery.",The Calm,Nature
JOHN DONNE,"Where, like a pillow on a bed
         A pregnant bank swell'd up to rest
The violet's reclining head,
         Sat we two, one another's best.
Our hands were firmly cemented
         With a fast balm, which thence did spring;
Our eye-beams twisted, and did thread
         Our eyes upon one double string;
So to'intergraft our hands, as yet
         Was all the means to make us one,
And pictures in our eyes to get
         Was all our propagation.
As 'twixt two equal armies fate
         Suspends uncertain victory,
Our souls (which to advance their state
         Were gone out) hung 'twixt her and me.
And whilst our souls negotiate there,
         We like sepulchral statues lay;
All day, the same our postures were,
         And we said nothing, all the day.
If any, so by love refin'd
         That he soul's language understood,
And by good love were grown all mind,
         Within convenient distance stood,
He (though he knew not which soul spake,
         Because both meant, both spake the same)
Might thence a new concoction take
         And part far purer than he came.
This ecstasy doth unperplex,
         We said, and tell us what we love;
We see by this it was not sex,
         We see we saw not what did move;
But as all several souls contain
         Mixture of things, they know not what,
Love these mix'd souls doth mix again
         And makes both one, each this and that.
A single violet transplant,
         The strength, the colour, and the size,
(All which before was poor and scant)
         Redoubles still, and multiplies.
When love with one another so
         Interinanimates two souls,
That abler soul, which thence doth flow,
         Defects of loneliness controls.
We then, who are this new soul, know
         Of what we are compos'd and made,
For th' atomies of which we grow
         Are souls, whom no change can invade.
But oh alas, so long, so far,
         Our bodies why do we forbear?
They'are ours, though they'are not we; we are
         The intelligences, they the spheres.
We owe them thanks, because they thus
         Did us, to us, at first convey,
Yielded their senses' force to us,
         Nor are dross to us, but allay.
On man heaven's influence works not so,
         But that it first imprints the air;
So soul into the soul may flow,
            Though it to body first repair.
As our blood labors to beget
         Spirits, as like souls as it can,
Because such fingers need to knit
         That subtle knot which makes us man,
So must pure lovers' souls descend
         T' affections, and to faculties,
Which sense may reach and apprehend,
         Else a great prince in prison lies.
To'our bodies turn we then, that so
         Weak men on love reveal'd may look;
Love's mysteries in souls do grow,
         But yet the body is his book.
And if some lover, such as we,
         Have heard this dialogue of one,
Let him still mark us, he shall see
         Small change, when we'are to bodies gone.",The Ecstasy,Nature

         As I have seen in one autumnal face.
Young beauties force our love, and that's a rape,
         This doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape.
If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame;
         Affection here takes reverence's name.
Were her first years the golden age? That's true,
         But now she's gold oft tried and ever new.
That was her torrid and inflaming time,
         This is her tolerable tropic clime.
Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence,
         He in a fever wishes pestilence.
Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were,
         They were Love's graves, for else he is no where.
Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit
         Vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit;
And here till hers, which must be his death, come,
         He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb.
Here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere
         In progress, yet his standing house is here:
Here where still evening is, not noon nor night,
         Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight.
In all her words, unto all hearers fit,
         You may at revels, you at council, sit.
This is Love's timber, youth his underwood;
         There he, as wine in June, enrages blood,
Which then comes seasonabliest when our taste
         And appetite to other things is past.
Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the platan tree,
         Was lov'd for age, none being so large as she,
Or else because, being young, nature did bless
         Her youth with age's glory, barrenness.
If we love things long sought, age is a thing
         Which we are fifty years in compassing;
If transitory things, which soon decay,
         Age must be loveliest at the latest day.
But name not winter faces, whose skin's slack,
         Lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack;
Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade;
         Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made;
Whose every tooth to a several place is gone,
         To vex their souls at resurrection:
Name not these living death's-heads unto me,
         For these, not ancient, but antique be.
I hate extremes, yet I had rather stay
         With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day.
Since such love's natural lation is, may still
         My love descend, and journey down the hill,
Not panting after growing beauties. So,

SIR THOMAS WYATT,"My mother's maids, when they did sew and spin,
They sang sometime a song of the field mouse,
That, for because her livelood was but thin,

Would needs go seek her townish sister's house.
She thought herself endured too much pain;
The stormy blasts her cave so sore did souse

That when the furrows swimmed with the rain,
She must lie cold and wet in sorry plight;
And worse than that, bare meat there did remain

To comfort her when she her house had dight;
Sometime a barley corn; sometime a bean;
For which she laboured hard both day and night

In harvest time whilst she might go and glean;
And where store was stroyed with the flood,
Then well away! for she undone was clean.

Then was she fain to take instead of food
Sleep, if she might, her hunger to beguile.
""My sister,"" quod she, ""hath a living good,

And hence from me she dwelleth not a mile.
In cold and storm she lieth warm and dry
In bed of down; the dirt doth not defile

Her tender foot, she laboureth not as I.
Richly she feedeth and at the richman's cost,
And for her meat she needs not crave nor cry.

By sea, by land, of the delicates, the most
Her cater seeks, and spareth for no peril.
She feedeth on boiled bacon meet and roast,

And hath thereof neither charge nor travail;
And when she list, the liquor of the grape
Doth glad her heart till that her belly swell.""

And at this journey she maketh but a jape;
So forth she goeth, trusting of all this wealth
With her sister her part so for to shape,

That if she might keep herself in health,
To live a lady while her life doth last.
And to the door now is she come by stealth,

And with her foot anon she scrapeth full fast.
Th' other for fear durst not well scarce appear,
Of every noise so was the wretch aghast.

At last she asked softly who was there.
And in her language, as well as she could,
""Peep!"" quod the other. ""Sister, I am here.""

""Peace,"" quod the towny mouse, ""why speakest thou so loud?""
And by the hand she took her fair and well.
""Welcome,"" quod she, ""my sister, by the Rood!""

She feasted her, that joy it was to tell
The fare they had; they drank the wine so clear,
And as to purpose now and then it fell,

She cheered her with ""How, sister, what cheer!""
Amids this joy befell a sorry chance,
That, well away! the stranger bought full dear

The fare she had, for, as she look askance,
Under a stool she spied two steaming eyes
In a round head with sharp ears. In France

Was never mouse so fear'd, for the unwise
Had not i-seen such a beast before,
Yet had nature taught her after her guise

To know her foe and dread him evermore.
The towny mouse fled, she know whither to go;
Th' other had no shift, but wonders sore

Feard of her life. At home she wished her tho,
And to the door, alas! as she did skip,
The Heaven it would, lo! and eke her chance was so,

At the threshold her silly foot did trip;
And ere she might recover it again,
The traitor cat had caught her by the hip,

And made her there against her will remain,
That had forgotten her poor surety and rest
For seeming wealth wherein she thought to reign.

Alas, my Poynz, how men do seek the best
And find the worst, by error as they stray!
And no marvail; when sight is so opprest.

And blind the guide; anon out of the way
Goeth guide and all in seeking quiet life.
O wretched minds, there is no gold that may

Grant that ye seek; no war, no peace, no strife.
No, no, although thy head were hooped with gold,
Sergeant with mace, hawbert, sword, nor knife,

Cannot repulse the care that follow should.
Each kind of life hath with him his disease.
Live in delight even as thy lust would,

And thou shalt find, when lust doth most thee please,
It irketh straight and by itself doth fade.
A small thing it is that may thy mind appease.

None of ye all there is that is so mad
To seek grapes upon brambles or breres;
Nor none, I trow, that hath his wit so bad

To set his hay for conies over rivers,
Ne ye set not a drag-net for an hare;
And yet the thing that most is your desire

Ye do mis-seek with more travail and care.
Make plain thine heart, that it be not knotted
With hope or dread, and see thy will be bare

From all affects, whom vice hath ever spotted.
Thyself content with that is thee assigned,
And use it well that is to thee allotted.

Then seek no more out of thyself to find
The thing that thou hast sought so long before,
For thou shalt feel it sitting in thy mind.

Mad, if ye list to continue your sore,
Let present pass and gape on time to come,
And deep yourself in travail more and more.

Henceforth, my Poynz, this shall be all and some,
These wretched fools shall have nought else of me;
But to the great God and to his high doom,

None other pain pray I for them to be,
But when the rage doth lead them from the right,
That, looking backward, Virtue they may see,

Even as she is, so goodly fair and bright;
And whilst they clasp their lusts in arms across,
Grant them, good Lord, as Thou mayst of Thy might
To fret inward for losing such a loss.",Of the Mean and Sure Estate,Nature
JOHN DONNE,"Forget this rotten world, and unto thee
Let thine own times as an old story be.
Be not concern'd; study not why, nor when;
Do not so much as not believe a man.
For though to err, be worst, to try truths forth
Is far more business than this world is worth.
I'he world is but a carcass; thou art fed
By it, but as a worm, that carcass bred;
And why shouldst thou, poor worm, consider more,
When this world will grow better than before,
Than those thy fellow-worms do think upon
That carcass's last resurrection?
Forget this world, and scarce think of it so,
As of old clothes, cast off a year ago.
To be thus stupid is alacrity;
Men thus lethargic have best memory.
Look upward; that's towards her, whose happy state
We now lament not, but congratulate.
She, to whom all this world was but a stage,
Where all sat heark'ning how her youthful age
Should be employ'd, because in all she did
Some figure of the golden times was hid.
Who could not lack, what'er this world could give,
Because she was the form, that made it live;
Nor could complain that this world was unfit
To be stay'd in, then when she was in it;
She, that first tried indifferent desires
By virtue, and virtue by religious fires;
She, to whose person paradise adher'd,
As courts to princes; she, whose eyes enspher'd
Star-light enough t' have made the South control,
(Had she been there) the star-full Northern Pole;
She, she is gone; she is gone; when thou knowest this,
What fragmentary rubbish this world is
Thou knowest, and that it is not worth a thought;
He honours it too much that thinks it nought.
Think then, my soul, that death is but a groom,
Which brings a taper to the outward room,
Whence thou spiest first a little glimmering light,
And after brings it nearer to thy sight;
For such approaches doth heaven make in death.
Think thyself labouring now with broken breath,
And think those broken and soft notes to be
Division, and thy happiest harmony.
Think thee laid on thy death-bed, loose and slack,
And think that but unbinding of a pack,
To take one precious thing, thy soul, from thence.
Think thyself parch'd with fever's violence;
Anger thine ague more, by calling it
Thy physic; chide the slackness of the fit.
Think that thou hear'st thy knell, and think no more,
But that, as bells call'd thee to church before,
So this to the Triumphant Church calls thee.
Think Satan's sergeants round about thee be,
And think that but for legacies they thrust;
Give one thy pride, to'another give thy lust;
Give them those sins which they gave thee before,
And trust th' immaculate blood to wash thy score.
Think thy friends weeping round, and think that they
Weep but because they go not yet thy way.
Think that they close thine eyes, and think in this,
That they confess much in the world amiss,
Who dare not trust a dead man's eye with that
Which they from God and angels cover not.
Think that they shroud thee up, and think from thence
They reinvest thee in white innocence.
Think that thy body rots, and (if so low,
Thy soul exalted so, thy thoughts can go)
Think thee a prince, who of themselves create
Worms, which insensibly devour their state.
Think that they bury thee, and think that rite

EDMUND SPENSER,"CALM was the day, and through the trembling air
Sweet breathing Zephyrus did softly play,
A gentle spirit, that lightly did delay
Hot Titan's beams, which then did glister fair;
When I whose sullen care,
Through discontent of my long fruitless stay
In prince's court, and expectation vain
Of idle hopes, which still do fly away
Like empty shadows, did afflict my brain,
Walked forth to ease my pain
Along the shore of silver streaming Thames,
Whose rutty bank, the which his river hems,
Was painted all with variable flowers,
And all the meads adorned with dainty gems,
Fit to deck maidens' bowers,
And crown their paramours,
Against the bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

There, in a meadow, by the river's side,
A flock of nymphs I chanced to espy,
All lovely daughters of the flood thereby,
With goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,
As each had been a bride;
And each one had a little wicker basket,
Made of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,
In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,
And with fine fingers cropt full featously
The tender stalks on high.
Of every sort, which in that meadow grew,
They gathered some; the violet pallid blue,
The little daisy, that at evening closes,
The virgin lily, and the primrose true,
With store of vermeil roses,
To deck their bridegrooms' posies
Against the bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

With that, I saw two swans of goodly hue
Come softly swimming down along the Lee;
Two fairer birds I yet did never see.
The snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,
Did never whiter shew,
Nor Jove himself, when he a swan would be
For love of Leda, whiter did appear:
Yet Leda was they say as white as he,
Yet not so white as these, nor nothing near.
So purely white they were,
That even the gentle stream, the which them bare,
Seemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare
To wet their silken feathers, lest they might
Soil their fair plumes with water not so fair,
And mar their beauties bright,
That shone as heaven's light,
Against their bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,
Ran all in haste, to see that silver brood,
As they came floating on the crystal flood.
Whom when they saw, they stood amazed still,
Their wondering eyes to fill.
Them seemed they never saw a sight so fair,
Of fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem
Them heavenly born, or to be that same pair
Which through the sky draw Venus' silver team;
For sure they did not seem
To be begot of any earthly seed,
But rather angels, or of angels' breed:
Yet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,
In sweetest season, when each flower and weed
The earth did fresh array,
So fresh they seemed as day,
Even as their bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

Then forth they all out of their baskets drew
Great store of flowers, the honour of the field,
That to the sense did fragrant odours yield,
All which upon those goodly birds they threw,
And all the waves did strew,
That like old Peneus' waters they did seem,
When down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,
Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,
That they appear through lilies' plenteous store,
Like a bride's chamber floor.
Two of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,
Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found,
The which presenting all in trim array,
Their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,
Whilst one did sing this lay,
Prepared against that day,
Against their bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,
And heaven's glory, whom this happy hour
Doth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower,
Joy may you have and gentle heart's content
Of your love's complement:
And let fair Venus, that is queen of love,
With her heart-quelling son upon you smile,
Whose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove
All love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile
For ever to assoil.
Let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,
And blessed plenty wait upon your board,
And let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,
That fruitful issue may to you afford,
Which may your foes confound,
And make your joys redound
Upon your bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.'

So ended she; and all the rest around
To her redoubled that her undersong,
Which said their bridal day should not be long.
And gentle echo from the neighbour ground
Their accents did resound.
So forth those joyous birds did pass along,
Adown the Lee, that to them murmured low,
As he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,
Yet did by signs his glad affection show,
Making his stream run slow.
And all the fowl which in his flood did dwell
Gan flock about these twain, that did excel
The rest so far as Cynthia doth shend
The lesser stars. So they, enranged well,
Did on those two attend,
And their best service lend,
Against their wedding day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

At length they all to merry London came,
To merry London, my most kindly nurse,
That to me gave this life's first native source;
Though from another place I take my name,
An house of ancient fame.
There when they came, whereas those bricky towers,
The which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,
Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers
There whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,
Till they decayed through pride:
Next whereunto there stands a stately place,
Where oft I gained gifts and goodly grace
Of that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,
Whose want too well now feels my friendless case.
But ah, here fits not well
Old woes but joys to tell
Against the bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

Yet therein now doth lodge a noble peer,
Great England's glory, and the world's wide wonder,
Whose dreadful name late through all Spain did thunder,
And Hercules' two pillars standing near
Did make to quake and fear:
Fair branch of honour, flower of chivalry,
That fillest England with thy triumph's fame,
Joy have thou of thy noble victory,
And endless happiness of thine own name
That promiseth the same:
That through thy prowess and victorious arms,
Thy country may be freed from foreign harms;
And great Elisa's glorious name may ring
Through all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,
Which some brave Muse may sing
To ages following,
Upon the bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

From those high towers this noble lord issuing,
Like radiant Hesper when his golden hair
In th'Ocean billows he hath bathed fair,
Descended to the river's open viewing,
With a great train ensuing.
Above the rest were goodly to be seen
Two gentle knights of lovely face and feature
Beseeming well the bower of any queen,
With gifts of wit and ornaments of nature,
Fit for so goodly stature;
That like the twins of Jove they seemed in sight,
Which deck the baldric of the heavens bright.
They two forth pacing to the river's side,
Received those two fair birds, their love's delight;
Which, at th' appointed tide,
Each one did make his bride
Against their bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",Prothalamion,Nature

Tell me good Hobbinoll, what garres thee greete?
What? hath some Wolfe thy tender Lambes ytorne?
Or is thy Bagpype broke, that soundes so sweete?
Or art thou of thy loved lasse forlorne?

Or bene thine eyes attempred to the yeare,
Quenching the gasping furrowes thirst with rayne?
Like April shoure, so stremes the trickling teares
Adowne thy cheeke, to quenche thy thristye payne.

And tuned it unto the Waters fall.

         doe bathe your brest,
Forsake your watry bowres, and hether looke,
         at my request:
And eke you Virgins, that on Parnasse dwell,
Whence floweth Helicon the learned well,
         Helpe me to blaze
         Her worthy praise,
Which in her sexe doth all excell.

Of fayre Eliza be your silver song,
         that blessed wight:
The flowre of Virgins, may shee florish long,
         In princely plight.
For shee is Syrinx daughter without spotte,
Which Pan the shepheards God of her begot:
         So sprong her grace
         Of heavenly race,
No mortall blemishe may her blotte.

See, where she sits upon the grassie greene,
         (O seemely sight)
Yclad in Scarlot like a mayden Queene,
         And Ermines white.
Upon her head a Cremosin coronet,
With Damaske roses and Daffadillies set:
         Bayleaves betweene,
         And Primroses greene
Embellish the sweete Violet.

Tell me, have ye seene her angelick face,
         Like Ph{oe}be fayre?
Her heavenly haveour, her princely grace
         can you well compare?
The Redde rose medled with the White yfere,
In either cheeke depeincten lively chere.
         Her modest eye,
         Her Majestie,
Where have you seene the like, but there?

I sawe Ph{oe}bus thrust out his golden hedde,
         upon her to gaze:
But when he sawe, how broade her beames did spredde,
         it did him amaze.
He blusht to see another Sunne belowe,
Ne durst againe his fyrye face out showe:
         Let him, if he dare,
         His brightnesse compare
With hers, to have the overthrowe.

Shewe thy selfe Cynthia with thy silver rayes,
         and be not abasht:
When shee the beames of her beauty displayes,
         O how art thou dasht?
But I will not match her with Latonaes seede,
Such follie great sorow to Niobe did breede.
         Now she is a stone,
         And makes dayly mone,
Warning all other to take heede.

Pan may be proud, that ever he begot

And Syrinx rejoyse, that ever was her lot
         to beare such an one.

To her will I offer a milkwhite Lamb:
         Shee is my goddesse plaine,

Albee forswonck and forswatt I am.

I see Calliope speede her to the place,
         where my Goddesse shines:
And after her the other Muses trace,
         with their Violines.
Bene they not Bay braunches, which they doe beare,
All for Elisa in her hand to weare?
         So sweetely they play,
         And sing all the way,
That it a heaven is to heare.

Lo how finely the graces can it foote
         to the Instrument:
They dauncen deffly, and singen soote,
         in their meriment.
Wants not a fourth grace, to make the daunce even?
Let that rowme to my Lady be yeven:
         She shalbe a grace,
         To fyll the fourth place,
And reigne with the rest in heaven.

And whither rennes this bevie of Ladies bright,

Of Olive braunches beares a Coronall:
         Olives bene for peace,

Such for a Princesse bene principall.

Ye shepheards daughters, that dwell on the greene,
         hye you there apace:
Let none come there, but that Virgins bene,
         to adorne her grace.
And when you come, whereas shee is in place,
See, that your rudeness doe not you disgrace:
         Binde your fillets faste,
         And gird in your waste,
For more finesse, with a tawdrie lace.

Bring hether the Pincke and purple Cullambine,
         With Gelliflowres:
Bring Coronations, and Sops in wine,

And Cowslips, and Kingcups, and loved Lillies:
         The pretie Pawnce,

Shall match with the fayre flowre Delice.

Now ryse up Elisa, decked as thou art,

And now ye daintie Damsells may depart
         echeone her way,

Piers, I have pyped erst so long with payne,
That all mine Oten reedes bene rent and wore:
And my poore Muse hath spent her spared store,
Yet little good hath got, and much lesse gayne,
Such pleasaunce makes the Grashopper so poore,
And ligge so layd, when Winter doth her straine.

The dapper ditties, that I wont devise,
To feede youthes fancie, and the flocking fry,
Delighten much: what I the bett for thy?

Whereto thou list their trayned willes entice.

Lyft up thy selfe out of the lowly dust:
And sing of bloody Mars, of wars, of giusts.
Turne thee to those, that weld the awful crowne,
To doubted Knights, whose woundlesse armour rusts,
And helmes unbruzed wexen dayly browne.

There may thy Muse display her fluttryng wing,
And stretch her selfe at large from East to West:
Whither thou list in fayre Elisa rest,
Or if thee please in bigger notes to sing,
Advaunce the worthy whome shee loveth best,
That first the white beare to the stake did bring.

And when the stubborne stroke of stronger stounds,
Has somewhat slackt the tenor of thy string:
Of love and lustihed tho mayst thou sing,
And carrol lowde, and leade the Myllers rownde,
All were Elisa one of thilke same ring.

Indeed the Romish Tityrus, I heare,
Through his Mecoenas left his Oaten reede,
Whereon he earst had taught his flocks to feede,
And laboured lands to yield the timely eare,
And eft did sing of warres and deadly drede,
So as the Heavens did quake his verse to here.

But ah Mecoenas is yclad in claye,
And great Augustus long ygoe is dead:
And all the worthies liggen wrapt in leade,
That matter made for Poets on to play:
For ever, who in derring doe were dreade,
The loftie verse of hem was loved aye.

But after vertue gan for age to stoupe,
And mighty manhode brought a bedde of ease:
The vaunting Poets found nought worth a pease,
To put in preace emong the learned troupe.
Tho gan the streames of flowing wittes to cease,
And sonnebright honour pend in shamefull coupe.

And if that any buddes of Poesie,
Yet of the old stocke gan to shoote agayne:
Or it mens follies mote be forst to fayne,
And rolle with rest in rymes of rybaudrye:
Or as it sprong, it wither must agayne:
Tom Piper makes us better melodie.

O pierlesse Poesye, where is then thy place?
If nor in Princes pallace thou doe sitt:
(And yet is Princes pallace the most fitt)
Ne brest of baser birth doth thee embrace.
Then make thee winges of thine aspyring wit,
And, whence thou camst, flye backe to heaven apace.

CUDDIE
Ah Percy it is all to weake and wanne,
So high to sore, and make so large a flight:
Her peeced pyneons bene not so in plight,
For Colin fittes such famous flight to scanne:
He, were he not with love so ill bedight,
Would mount as high, and sing as soote as Swanne.

PIERS
Ah fon, for love does teach him climbe so hie,
And lyftes him up out of the loathsome myre:
Such immortall mirrhor, as he doth admire,
Would rayse ones mynd above the starry skie.
And cause a caytive corage to aspire,
For lofty love doth loath a lowly eye.

CUDDIE
All otherwise the state of Poet stands,
For lordly love is such a Tyranne fell:
That where he rules, all power he doth expell.
The vaunted verse a vacant head demaundes,
Ne wont with crabbed care the Muses dwell.
Unwisely weaves, that takes two webbes in hand.

Who ever casts to compasse weightye prise,
And thinks to throwe out thondring words of threate:
Let powre in lavish cups and thriftie bitts of meate,
For Bacchus fruite is frend to Phoebus wise.
And when with Wine the braine begins to sweate,
The nombers flowe as fast as spring doth ryse.

Thou kenst not Percie howe the ryme should rage.
O if my temples were distaind with wine,
And girt in girlonds of wild Yvie twine,
How I could reare the Muse on stately stage,
And teache her tread aloft in buskin fine,
With queint Bellona in her equipage.

But ah my corage cooles ere it be warme,
For thy, content us in thys humble shade:
Where no such troublous tydes han us assayde,
Here we our slender pipes may safely charme.

PIERS
And when my Gates shall han their bellies layd:
Cuddie shall have a Kidde to store his farme.

Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;

To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
For no man well of such a salve can speak
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
The offenders sorrow lends but weak relief
To him that bears the strong offences cross.

For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,
Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?

Foul precurrer of the fiend,
Augur of the fever's end,

Here the anthem doth commence:
Love and constancy is dead;
Phoenix and the Turtle fled
In a mutual flame from hence.

So they lov'd, as love in twain
Had the essence but in one;
Two distincts, division none:
Number there in love was slain.

Hearts remote, yet not asunder;
Distance and no space was seen
'Twixt this Turtle and his queen:
But in them it were a wonder.

So between them love did shine
That the Turtle saw his right
Flaming in the Phoenix' sight:
Either was the other's mine.

Property was thus appalled
That the self was not the same;
Single nature's double name
Neither two nor one was called.

Reason, in itself confounded,
Saw division grow together,
To themselves yet either neither,
Simple were so well compounded;

That it cried, ""How true a twain
Seemeth this concordant one!
Love has reason, reason none,
If what parts can so remain.""

Whereupon it made this threne
To the Phoenix and the Dove,
Co-supremes and stars of love,
As chorus to their tragic scene:

                 threnos

Beauty, truth, and rarity,
Grace in all simplicity,
Here enclos'd, in cinders lie.

Death is now the Phoenix' nest,
And the Turtle's loyal breast
To eternity doth rest,

Leaving no posterity:
'Twas not their infirmity,
It was married chastity.

Truth may seem but cannot be;
Beauty brag but 'tis not she;
Truth and beauty buried be.

That are either true or fair;
For these dead birds sigh a prayer.",The Phoenix and the Turtle,Love
GEORGE GASCOIGNE,"     Sing lullaby, as women do,
Wherewith they bring their babes to rest,
And lullaby can I sing too
As womanly as can the best.
With lullaby they still the child,
And if I be not much beguiled,
Full many wanton babes have I
Which must be stilled with lullaby.

     First lullaby my youthful years;
It is now time to go to bed,
For crooked age and hoary hairs
Have won the haven within my head.
With lullaby, then, youth be still;
With lullaby content thy will;
Since courage quails and comes behind,
Go sleep, and so beguile thy mind.

     Next, lullaby my gazing eyes,
Which wonted were to glance apace.
For every glass may now suffice
To show the furrows in my face;
With lullaby then wink awhile,
With lullaby your looks beguile;
Let no fair face nor beauty bright
Entice you eft with vain delight.

     And lullaby, my wanton will;
Let reason's rule now reign thy thought,
Since all too late I find by skill
How dear I have thy fancies bought;
With lullaby now take thine ease,
With lullaby thy doubts appease.
For trust to this: if thou be still,
My body shall obey thy will.

     Eke lullaby, my loving boy,
My little Robin, take thy rest;
Since age is cold and nothing coy,
Keep close thy coin, for so is best;
With lullaby be thou content,
With lullaby thy lusts relent,
Let others pay which hath mo pence;
Thou art too poor for such expense.

     Thus lullaby, my youth, mine eyes,
My will, my ware, and all that was.
I can no mo delays devise,
But welcome pain, let pleasure pass;
With lullaby now take your leave,
With lullaby your dreams deceive;
And when you rise with waking eye,
Remember then this lullaby.",The Lullaby of a Lover,Love

Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken,
A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed.
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
Whoeer keeps me, let my heart be his guard:

Is more than my oerpressed defense can bide?
Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries

And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
Robbed others beds revenues of their rents.

Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.

Should in despite of light keep us together.

Light hath no tongue, but is all eye;

"SECOND BARON VAUX OF HARROWDEN THOMAS, LORD VAUX","I loathe that I did love,
In youth that I thought sweet,
As time requires for my behove,
Methinks they are not meet.

My lusts they do me leave,
My fancies all be fled,
And tract of time begins to weave
Grey hairs upon my head,

Hath clawed me with his crutch,

As there had been none such.

My Muse doth not delight
Me as she did before;
My hand and pen are not in plight,
As they have been of yore.

This youthly idle rhyme;
And day by day to me she cries,
Leave off these toys in time.

The furrows in my face,

Where youth must give him place.

The harbinger of death,
To me I see him ride,
The cough, the cold, the gasping breath
Doth bid me provide

A pickaxe and a spade,
And eke a shrouding sheet,
A house of clay for to be made
For such a guest most meet.

Methinks I hear the clark
That knolls the careful knell,
And bids me leave my woeful wark,
Ere nature me compel.

My keepers knit the knot
That youth did laugh to scorn,
Of me that clean shall be forgot
As I had not been born.

Thus must I youth give up,
Whose badge I long did wear;
To them I yield the wanton cup
That better may it bear.

Lo, here the bared skull,
By whose bald sign I know
That stooping age away shall pull
Which youthful years did sow.

These crooked cares hath wrought,

From whence I first was brought.

A horseman to my horse, a horse to Love,
And now mans wrongs in me, poor beast, descry.
The reins wherewith my rider doth me tie
Are humbled thoughts, which bit of reverence move,
Curbed in with fear, but with gilt boss above
Of hope, which makes it seem fair to the eye.
The wand is will; thou, fancy, saddle art,
Girt fast by memory; and while I spur
My horse, he spurs with sharp desire to my heart;
He sits me fast, however I do stir;
And now hath made me to his hand so right
That in the manage myself takes delight.","Astrophil and Stella 49: I on my horse, and Love on me, doth try ",Love
SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"It is most true, that eyes are formed to serve
The inward light; and that the heavenly part
Ought to be king, from whose rules who do swerve,
Rebels to Nature, strive for their own smart.
    It is most true, what we call Cupids dart,
An image is, which for ourselves we carve;
And, fools, adore in temple of our heart,
Till that good god make Church and churchman starve.
    True, that true beauty virtue is indeed,
Whereof this beauty can be but a shade,
Which elements with mortal mixture breed;
True, that on earth we are but pilgrims made,
    And should in soul up to our country move;
True; and yet true, that I must Stella love.","Astrophil and Stella 5: It is most true, that eyes are formed to serve",Love
SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"A strife is grown between Virtue and Love,
While each pretends that Stella must be his:
Her eyes, her lips, her all, saith Love, do this,
Since they do wear his badge, most firmly prove.
But Virtue thus that title doth disprove,
That Stella (O dear name) that Stella is
That virtuous soul, sure heir of heavnly bliss;
Not this fair outside, which our hearts doth move.
And therefore, though her beauty and her grace
Be Loves indeed, in Stellas self he may
By no pretense claim any manner place.
Well, Love, since this demur our suit doth stay,
Let Virtue have that Stella's self; yet thus,
Let Virtue but that body grant to us.",Astrophil and Stella 52: A strife is grown between Virtue and Love,Love

A nest for my young praise in laurel tree:

Graved in mine epitaph a Poets name:
Nay if I would, could I just title make,

Whether it best be more to mell,

Thou never yet wouldst credit give

No, no, thou never didst me good,

Yet am I in no angry mood,

In perfect love and charity,

Those eyes that were my food;
Which sometime so delighted me,
That yet they do me good;
Wherewith I wake with his return,
Whose absent flame did make me burn:
But when I find the lack, Lord, how I mourn!

When other lovers in arms across
Rejoice their chief delight.
Drowned in tears, to mourn my loss
I stand the bitter night
In my window, where I may see
Before the winds how the clouds flee.
Lo! what a mariner love hath made of me!

And in green waves when the salt flood
Doth rise by rage of wind,
A thousand fancies in that mood
Assail my restless mind.
Alas! now drencheth my sweet foe,
That with the spoil of my heart did go,
And left me; but, alas! why did he so?

And when the seas wax calm again
To chase fro me annoy,
My doubtful hope doth cause me pain;
So dread cuts off my joy.
Thus is my wealth mingled with woe,
And of each thought a doubt doth grow;
Now he comes! Will he come? Alas, no, no!

Like twilight glimpse at setting of the sun
Or night being past, and yet not day begun.
Such light to shamefaced maidens must be shown,
Where they may sport, and seem to be unknown.
Then came Corinna in a long loose gown,
Her white neck hid with tresses hanging down:
Resembling fair Semiramis going to bed
Or Lais of a thousand wooers sped.
I snatched her gown, being thin, the harm was small,
Yet strived she to be covered therewithal.
And striving thus as one that would be cast,
Betrayed herself, and yielded at the last.
Stark naked as she stood before mine eye,
Not one wen in her body could I spy.

What arms and shoulders did I touch and see,
How apt her breasts were to be pressed by me?
How smooth a belly under her waist saw I?
How large a leg, and what a lusty thigh?
To leave the rest, all liked me passing well,
I clinged her naked body, down she fell,

A quenchless fire, a nurse of trembling fear,

JOHN DONNE,"I scarce believe my love to be so pure

   Because it doth endure
Vicissitude, and season, as the grass;
Methinks I lied all winter, when I swore
My love was infinite, if spring make it more.

But if medicine, love, which cures all sorrow
With more, not only be no quintessence,
But mixed of all stuffs paining soul or sense,
And of the sun his working vigor borrow,
Loves not so pure, and abstract, as they use
To say, which have no mistress but their muse,
But as all else, being elemented too,
Love sometimes would contemplate, sometimes do.

And yet no greater, but more eminent,
   Love by the spring is grown;
   As, in the firmament,
Stars by the sun are not enlarged, but shown,
Gentle love deeds, as blossoms on a bough,
From loves awakened root do bud out now.

If, as water stirred more circles be
Produced by one, love such additions take,
Those, like so many spheres, but one heaven make,
For they are all concentric unto thee;
And though each spring do add to love new heat,
As princes do in time of action get
New taxes, and remit them not in peace,
No winter shall abate the springs increase.",Love's Growth,Love

Have more cause to lament me,
Since wanting is more woe than too much having.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,
Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;
Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,
Swelling on either side to want his bliss;
Between whose hills her head entombed is;
Where like a virtuous monument she lies,
To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes.

Without the bed her other fair hand was,
On the green coverlet, whose perfect white
Showed like an April daisy on the grass,
With pearly sweat resembling dew of night.
Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,
And canopied in darkness sweetly lay
Till they might open to adorn the day.

Her hair like golden threads played with her breath
O modest wantons, wanton modesty!
Showing lifes triumph in the map of death,
And deaths dim look in lifes mortality.
Each in her sleep themselves so beautify
As if between them twain there were no strife,
But that life lived in death, and death in life.

Her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue,
A pair of maiden worlds unconquered,
Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,
And him by oath they truly honoured.
These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred,
Who like a foul usurper went about
From this fair throne to heave the owner out.

What could he see but mightily he noted?
What did he note but strongly he desired?
What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,
And in his will his willful eye he tired.
With more than admiration he admired
Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,
Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.

As the grim lion fawneth oer his prey
Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,
So oer this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,
His rage of lust by gazing qualified;
Slacked, not suppressed; for, standing by her side,
His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,
Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins.

And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,
Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting.
In bloody death and ravishment delighting,
Nor childrens tears nor mothers groans respecting,
Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting.
Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,
Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.

His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,
His eye commends the leading to his hand;
His hand, as proud of such a dignity,
Smoking with pride, marched on to make his stand
On her bare breast, the heart of all her land,
Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,
Left their round turrets destitute and pale.

They, mustering to the quiet cabinet
Where their dear governess and lady lies,
Do tell her she is dreadfully beset
And fright her with confusion of their cries.
She, much amazed, breaks ope her locked-up eyes,
Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,
Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled.

Imagine her as one in dead of night
From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,
That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,
Whose grim aspect sets every joint a-shaking.
What terror tis! but she, in worser taking,
From sleep disturbed, heedfully doth view
The sight which makes supposed terror true.

Wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears,
Like to a new-killed bird she trembling lies.
She dares not look; yet, winking, there appears
Quick-shifting antics ugly in her eyes.
Such shadows are the weak brains forgeries,
Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,
In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.

His hand, that yet remains upon her breast
(Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!)
May feel her heart (poor citizen) distressed,
Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,
Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.
This moves in him more rage and lesser pity,
To make the breach and enter this sweet city.",from The Rape of Lucrece,Love

And yet he robs me of my rest.
Ah, wanton, will ye?

And if I sleep, then percheth he
With pretty flight,
And makes his pillow of my knee

He music plays if so I sing;
He lends me every lovely thing;
Yet cruel he my heart doth sting.

Because a god.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
And like enough thou knowst thy estimate.
The Charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
My bonds in thee are all determinate.
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,
And for that riches where is my deserving?
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
And so my patent back again is swerving.
Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
Comes home again, on better judgement making.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"From you have I been absent in the spring,
When proud-pied April, dressed in all his trim,
Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
Could make me any summers story tell,
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
Nor did I wonder at the lilys white,
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
They were but sweet, but figures of delight
Drawn after you,  you pattern of all those.
    Yet seemd it winter still, and, you away,

For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
Have from the forests shook three summers pride,
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned
In process of the seasons have I seen,
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived:
For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred:
Ere you were born was beautys summer dead.","Sonnet 104: To me, fair friend, you never can be old",Love

Though absence seemed my flame to qualify.
As easy might I from myself depart
As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:
That is my home of love; if I have ranged,
Like him that travels, I return again,
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
So that myself bring water for my stain.
Never believe, though in my nature reigned
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
That it could so preposterously be stained,
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;

Dost hold times fickle glass his sickle hour,
Who hast by waning grown, and therein showst
Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growst
In nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
May time disgrace, and wretched minute kill.
Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure;
She may detain but not still keep her treasure.

More than enough am I that vex thee still,
To thy sweet will making addition thus.
Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
Shall will in others seem right gracious,
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?

And in abundance addeth to his store;

That she might think me some untutored youth,
Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties.
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
Although she knows my days are past the best,
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
And wherefore say not I that I am old?

And age in love loves not to have years told.

Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone:
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be.

The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.
To win me soon to hell, my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side,
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
And, whether that my angel be turnd fiend,
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,
But being both from me both to each friend,
I guess one angel in anothers hell.

To those true numerous graces, whereof some
But charm the senses, others overcome
Both brains and hearts; and mine now best do know it:
For in your verse all Cupids armory,

Seals of love, though sealed in vain.

On whose tops the pinks that grow
Are of those that April wears;

Bound in those icy chains by thee.","Take, Oh, Take Those Lips Away",Love

And then again, I have been told

So that I fear they do but bring
    Extremes to touch, and mean one thing.

As in a ruin we it call
    One thing to be blown up, or fall;
Or to our end like way may have
    By a flash of lightning, or a wave;

She hath left me here all alone,
All alone as unknown,
Who sometimes did me lead with her self,

Whats the cause that she leaves you alone

Who loved you once as her own

I have loved her all my youth,
But now old, as you see,
Love likes not the falling fruit
From the withered tree.

Know that love is a careless child
And forgets promise past,
He is blind, he is deaf when he list
And in faith never fast.

His desire is a dureless content
And a trustless joy

And is lost with a toy.

Of womenkind such indeed is the love

And virtue sank the deeper in his breast;
Such profit he of envy could obtain.

A head, where wisdom mysteries did frame,
Whose hammers beat still in that lively brain
As on a stith, where some work of fame
Was daily wrought, to turn to Britains gain.

A visage, stern and mild; where both did grow,
Vice to condemn, in virtues to rejoice;
Amid great storms whom grace assured so,
To live upright and smile at fortunes choice.

That reft Chaucer the glory of his wit;
A mark the which (unperfited, for time)

Whose courteous talk to virtue did enflame
Each noble heart; a worthy guide to bring
Our English youth, by travail unto fame.

An eye whose judgment no affect could blind,
Friends to allure, and foes to reconcile;
Whose piercing look did represent a mind
With virtue fraught, reposed, void of guile.

In neither fortune lift, nor so repressed,
To swell in wealth, nor yield unto mischance.

Nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight,
Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light
T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne,
And beautify this sacred hymn of thine:

That both to thee, to whom I mean it most,
And eke to her, whose fair immortal beam
Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost,
That now it wasted is with woes extreme,
It may so please, that she at length will stream
Some dew of grace into my withered heart,
After long sorrow and consuming smart.

WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast
To make all things such as we now behold,
It seems that he before his eyes had plac'd
A goodly pattern, to whose perfect mould
He fashion'd them as comely as he could;
That now so fair and seemly they appear,
As nought may be amended anywhere.

That wondrous pattern, wheresoe'er it be,
Whether in earth laid up in secret store,
Or else in heaven, that no man may it see
With sinful eyes, for fear it to deflore,
Is perfect Beauty, which all men adore;
Whose face and feature doth so much excel
All mortal sense, that none the same may tell.

Thereof as every earthly thing partakes
Or more or less, by influence divine,
So it more fair accordingly it makes,
And the gross matter of this earthly mine,
Which clotheth it, thereafter doth refine,
Doing away the dross which dims the light
Of that fair beam which therein is empight.

For, through infusion of celestial power,
The duller earth it quick'neth with delight,
And lifeful spirits privily doth pour
Through all the parts, that to the looker's sight
They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might,
O Cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam
Of thy bright star, thou into them dost stream.

That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace
To all things fair, that kindleth lively fire,
Light of thy lamp, which, shining in the face,
Thence to the soul darts amorous desire,
And robs the hearts of those which it admire;
Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow,
That wounds the life, and wastes the inmost marrow.

How vainly then do idle wits invent,
That beauty is nought else but mixture made
Of colours fair, and goodly temp'rament
Of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade
And pass away, like to a summer's shade;
Or that it is but comely composition
Of parts well measur'd, with meet disposition.

Hath white and red in it such wondrous power,
That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart,
And therein stir such rage and restless stour,
As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?
Or can proportion of the outward part
Move such affection in the inward mind,
That it can rob both sense and reason blind?

Why do not then the blossoms of the field,
Which are array'd with much more orient hue,
And to the sense most dainty odours yield,
Work like impression in the looker's view?
Or why do not fair pictures like power shew,
In which oft-times we nature see of art
Excell'd, in perfect limning every part?

But ah, believe me, there is more than so,
That works such wonders in the minds of men;
I, that have often prov'd, too well it know,
And whoso list the like assays to ken,
Shall find by trial, and confess it then,
That beauty is not, as fond men misdeem,
An outward shew of things, that only seem.

For that same goodly hue of white and red,
With which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay,
And those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread
Upon the lips, shall fade and fall away
To that they were, even to corrupted clay;
That golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright,
Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.

But that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray
That light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,
Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay;
But when the vital spirits do expire,
Unto her native planet shall retire;
For it is heavenly born and cannot die,
Being a parcel of the purest sky.

For when the soul, the which derived was,
At first, out of that great immortal Spright,
By whom all live to love, whilom did pass
Down from the top of purest heaven's height
To be embodied here, it then took light
And lively spirits from that fairest star,
Which lights the world forth from his fiery car.

Which power retaining still or more or less,
When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced,
Through every part she doth the same impress,
According as the heavens have her graced,
And frames her house, in which she will be placed,
Fit for herself, adorning it with spoil
Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.

Thereof it comes that these fair souls, which have
The most resemblance of that heavenly light,
Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave
Their fleshly bower, most fit for their delight,
And the gross matter by a sovereign might
Tempers so trim, that it may well be seen
A palace fit for such a virgin queen.

So every spirit, as it is most pure,
And hath in it the more of heavenly light,
So it the fairer body doth procure
To habit in, and it more fairly dight
With cheerful grace and amiable sight.
For of the soul the body form doth take:
For soul is form, and doth the body make.

Therefore wherever that thou dost behold
A comely corpse, with beauty fair endued,
Know this for certain, that the same doth hold
A beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed,
Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.
For all that fair is, is by nature good;
That is a sign to know the gentle blood.

Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind
Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd,
Either by chance, against the course of kind,
Or through unaptness in the substance found,
Which it assumed of some stubborn ground,
That will not yield unto her form's direction,
But is deform'd with some foul imperfection.

And oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue)
That goodly beauty, albe heavenly born,
Is foul abus'd, and that celestial hue,
Which doth the world with her delight adorn,
Made but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn,
Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it,
But every one doth seek but to deprave it.

Yet nathemore is that fair beauty's blame,
But theirs that do abuse it unto ill:
Nothing so good, but that through guilty shame
May be corrupt, and wrested unto will:
Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still,
However flesh{""e}s fault it filthy make;
For things immortal no corruption take.

But ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments
And lively images of heaven's light,
Let not your beams with such disparagements
Be dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite;
But mindful still of your first country's sight,
Do still preserve your first informed grace,
Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.

Loathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand,
Disloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame,
That base affections, which your ears would bland,
Commend to you by love's abused name,
But is indeed the bondslave of defame;
Which will the garland of your glory mar,
And quench the light of your bright shining star.

But gentle Love, that loyal is and true,
Will more illumine your resplendent ray,
And add more brightness to your goodly hue,
From light of his pure fire; which, by like way
Kindled of yours, your likeness doth display;
Like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,
Do both express the face's first impression.

Therefore, to make your beauty more appear,
It you behoves to love, and forth to lay
That heavenly riches which in you ye bear,
That men the more admire their fountain may;
For else what booteth that celestial ray,
If it in darkness be enshrined ever,
That it of loving eyes be viewed never?

But, in your choice of loves, this well advise,
That likest to yourselves ye them select,
The which your forms' first source may sympathize,
And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;
For, if you loosely love without respect,
It is no love, but a discordant war,
Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.

For love is a celestial harmony
Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent,
Which join together in sweet sympathy,
To work each other's joy and true content,
Which they have harbour'd since their first descent
Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see
And know each other here belov'd to be.

Then wrong it were that any other twain
Should in love's gentle band combined be
But those whom Heaven did at first ordain,
And made out of one mould the more t' agree;
For all that like the beauty which they see,
Straight do not love; for love is not so light
As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.

But they, which love indeed, look otherwise,
With pure regard and spotless true intent,
Drawing out of the object of their eyes
A more refined form, which they present
Unto their mind, void of all blemishment;
Which it reducing to her first perfection,
Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.

And then conforming it unto the light,
Which in itself it hath remaining still,
Of that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,
Thereof he fashions in his higher skill
An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;
And it embracing in his mind entire,
The mirror of his own thought doth admire.

Which seeing now so inly fair to be,
As outward it appeareth to the eye,
And with his spirit's proportion to agree,
He thereon fixeth all his fantasy,
And fully setteth his felicity;
Counting it fairer than it is indeed,
And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.

For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be
Than other men's, and in dear love's delight
See more than any other eyes can see,
Through mutual receipt of beam{""e}s bright,
Which carry privy message to the spright,
And to their eyes that inmost fair display,
As plain as light discovers dawning day.

Therein they see, through amorous eye-glances,
Armies of loves still flying to and fro,
Which dart at them their little fiery lances;
Whom having wounded, back again they go,
Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;
Who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,
Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.

In which how many wonders do they rede
To their conceit, that others never see,
Now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,
Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;
Now of her looks, which like to cordials be;
But when her words' embassade forth she sends,
Lord, how sweet music that unto them lends.

Sometimes upon her forehead they behold
A thousand graces masking in delight;
Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold
Ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight
Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;
But on her lips, like rosy buds in May,
So many millions of chaste pleasures play.

All those, O Cytherea, and thousands more
Thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,
To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,
That may it more to mortal eyes commend,
And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:
That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,
And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.

Then Io, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen,
Advance the banner of thy conquest high,
That all this world, the which thy vassals bene,
May draw to thee, and with due fealty
Adore the power of thy great majesty,
Singing this hymn in honour of thy name,
Compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am.

In lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign,
That she whose conquering beauty doth captive
My trembling heart in her eternal chain,
One drop of grace at length will to me give,
That I her bounden thrall by her may live,
And this same life, which first fro me she reaved,
May owe to her, of whom I it received.

And you, fair Venus' darling, my dear dread,
Fresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life,
When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read,
Deign to let fall one drop of due relief,
That may recure my heart's long pining grief,
And shew what wondrous power your beauty hath,
That can restore a damned wight from death.",An Hymn In Honour Of Beauty,Love

That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,
Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,
Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,

Studying inventions fine her wits to entertain,
Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburn'd brain.
But words came halting forth, wanting invention's stay;
Invention, Nature's child, fled step-dame Study's blows;

EN JONSON,"See the chariot at hand here of Love,
Wherein my lady rideth!
Each that draws is a swan or a dove,
And well the car Love guideth.
As she goes, all hearts do duty
Unto her beauty;
And enamour'd, do wish, so they might
But enjoy such a sight,
That they still were to run by her side,
Through swords, through seas, whither she would ride.

Do but look on her eyes, they do light
All that Love's world compriseth!
Do but look on her hair, it is bright
As Love's star when it riseth!
Do but mark, her forehead's smoother
Than words that soothe her;
And from her arched brows, such a grace
Sheds itself through the face
As alone there triumphs to the life
All the gain, all the good, of the elements' strife.

Before rude hands have touch'd it?

GEORGE CHAPMAN,"Muses that sing love's sensual empery,
And lovers kindling your enraged fires
At Cupid's bonfires burning in the eye,
Blown with the empty breath of vain desires;
You that prefer the painted cabinet
Before the wealthy jewels it doth store ye,
That all your joys in dying figures set,
And stain the living substance of your glory;
Abjure those joys, abhor their memory,
And let my love the honour'd subject be
Of love, and honour's complete history.
Your eyes were never yet let in to see
The majesty and riches of the mind,
But dwell in darkness; for your god is blind.","A Coronet for his Mistress, Philosophy",Love
JOHN DONNE,"Dear love, for nothing less than thee
Would I have broke this happy dream;
            It was a theme
For reason, much too strong for fantasy,
Therefore thou wak'd'st me wisely; yet
My dream thou brok'st not, but continued'st it.
Thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice
To make dreams truths, and fables histories;
Enter these arms, for since thou thought'st it best,
Not to dream all my dream, let's act the rest.

   As lightning, or a taper's light,
Thine eyes, and not thy noise wak'd me;
            Yet I thought thee
(For thou lovest truth) an angel, at first sight;
But when I saw thou sawest my heart,
And knew'st my thoughts, beyond an angel's art,
When thou knew'st what I dreamt, when thou knew'st when
Excess of joy would wake me, and cam'st then,
I must confess, it could not choose but be
Profane, to think thee any thing but thee.

   Coming and staying show'd thee, thee,
But rising makes me doubt, that now
            Thou art not thou.
That love is weak where fear's as strong as he;
'Tis not all spirit, pure and brave,
If mixture it of fear, shame, honour have;
Perchance as torches, which must ready be,
Men light and put out, so thou deal'st with me;
Thou cam'st to kindle, goest to come; then I
Will dream that hope again, but else would die.",The Dream,Love
JOHN DONNE,"Where, like a pillow on a bed
         A pregnant bank swell'd up to rest
The violet's reclining head,
         Sat we two, one another's best.
Our hands were firmly cemented
         With a fast balm, which thence did spring;
Our eye-beams twisted, and did thread
         Our eyes upon one double string;
So to'intergraft our hands, as yet
         Was all the means to make us one,
And pictures in our eyes to get
         Was all our propagation.
As 'twixt two equal armies fate
         Suspends uncertain victory,
Our souls (which to advance their state
         Were gone out) hung 'twixt her and me.
And whilst our souls negotiate there,
         We like sepulchral statues lay;
All day, the same our postures were,
         And we said nothing, all the day.
If any, so by love refin'd
         That he soul's language understood,
And by good love were grown all mind,
         Within convenient distance stood,
He (though he knew not which soul spake,
         Because both meant, both spake the same)
Might thence a new concoction take
         And part far purer than he came.
This ecstasy doth unperplex,
         We said, and tell us what we love;
We see by this it was not sex,
         We see we saw not what did move;
But as all several souls contain
         Mixture of things, they know not what,
Love these mix'd souls doth mix again
         And makes both one, each this and that.
A single violet transplant,
         The strength, the colour, and the size,
(All which before was poor and scant)
         Redoubles still, and multiplies.
When love with one another so
         Interinanimates two souls,
That abler soul, which thence doth flow,
         Defects of loneliness controls.
We then, who are this new soul, know
         Of what we are compos'd and made,
For th' atomies of which we grow
         Are souls, whom no change can invade.
But oh alas, so long, so far,
         Our bodies why do we forbear?
They'are ours, though they'are not we; we are
         The intelligences, they the spheres.
We owe them thanks, because they thus
         Did us, to us, at first convey,
Yielded their senses' force to us,
         Nor are dross to us, but allay.
On man heaven's influence works not so,
         But that it first imprints the air;
So soul into the soul may flow,
            Though it to body first repair.
As our blood labors to beget
         Spirits, as like souls as it can,
Because such fingers need to knit
         That subtle knot which makes us man,
So must pure lovers' souls descend
         T' affections, and to faculties,
Which sense may reach and apprehend,
         Else a great prince in prison lies.
To'our bodies turn we then, that so
         Weak men on love reveal'd may look;
Love's mysteries in souls do grow,
         But yet the body is his book.
And if some lover, such as we,
         Have heard this dialogue of one,
Let him still mark us, he shall see
         Small change, when we'are to bodies gone.",The Ecstasy,Love
JOHN DONNE,"No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace
         As I have seen in one autumnal face.
Young beauties force our love, and that's a rape,
         This doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape.
If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame;
         Affection here takes reverence's name.
Were her first years the golden age? That's true,
         But now she's gold oft tried and ever new.
That was her torrid and inflaming time,
         This is her tolerable tropic clime.
Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence,
         He in a fever wishes pestilence.
Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were,
         They were Love's graves, for else he is no where.
Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit
         Vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit;
And here till hers, which must be his death, come,
         He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb.
Here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere
         In progress, yet his standing house is here:
Here where still evening is, not noon nor night,
         Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight.
In all her words, unto all hearers fit,
         You may at revels, you at council, sit.
This is Love's timber, youth his underwood;
         There he, as wine in June, enrages blood,
Which then comes seasonabliest when our taste
         And appetite to other things is past.
Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the platan tree,
         Was lov'd for age, none being so large as she,
Or else because, being young, nature did bless
         Her youth with age's glory, barrenness.
If we love things long sought, age is a thing
         Which we are fifty years in compassing;
If transitory things, which soon decay,
         Age must be loveliest at the latest day.
But name not winter faces, whose skin's slack,
         Lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack;
Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade;
         Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made;
Whose every tooth to a several place is gone,
         To vex their souls at resurrection:
Name not these living death's-heads unto me,
         For these, not ancient, but antique be.
I hate extremes, yet I had rather stay
         With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day.
Since such love's natural lation is, may still
         My love descend, and journey down the hill,
Not panting after growing beauties. So,
         I shall ebb on with them who homeward go.",Elegy IX: The Autumnal,Love
JOHN DONNE,"Here take my picture; though I bid farewell
Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell.
'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more
When we are shadows both, than 'twas before.
When weather-beaten I come back, my hand
Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann'd,
My face and breast of haircloth, and my head
With care's rash sudden storms being o'erspread,
My body'a sack of bones, broken within,
And powder's blue stains scatter'd on my skin;
If rival fools tax thee to'have lov'd a man
So foul and coarse as, oh, I may seem then,
This shall say what I was, and thou shalt say,
""Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay?
Or do they reach his judging mind, that he
Should now love less, what he did love to see?
That which in him was fair and delicate,
Was but the milk which in love's childish state
Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough
To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough.""",Elegy V: His Picture,Love

Be not yet those fancies changed?""
Dear, when you find change in me,
Though from me you be estranged,
Let my change to ruin be.

""Well, in absence this will die;
Leave to see, and leave to wonder.""
Absence sure will help, if I
Can learn how myself to sunder
From what in my heart doth lie.

""But time will these thoughts remove;
Time doth work what no man knoweth.""
Time doth as the subject prove;
With time still the affection groweth
In the faithful turtle-dove.

""What if you new beauties see?
Will not they stir new affection?""
I will think they pictures be,
Image-like, of saints' perfection,
Poorly counterfeiting thee.

""But your reason's purest light
Bids you leave such minds to nourish.""
Dear, do reason no such spite;
Never doth thy beauty flourish
More than in my reason's sight.

""But the wrongs love bears will make
Love at length leave undertaking.""
No, the more fools it do shake,
In a ground of so firm making
Deeper still they drive the stake.

""Peace, I think that some give ear!
Come no more, lest I get anger!""
Bliss, I will my bliss forbear;
Fearing, sweet, you to endanger;
But my soul shall harbour there.

CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE,"On Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood,
In view and opposite two cities stood,
Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might;
The one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.
At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,
Whom young Apollo courted for her hair,
And offer'd as a dower his burning throne,
Where she could sit for men to gaze upon.
The outside of her garments were of lawn,
The lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;
Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,
Where Venus in her naked glory strove
To please the careless and disdainful eyes
Of proud Adonis, that before her lies;
Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain.
Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,
From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;
Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives;
Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;
And there for honey bees have sought in vain,
And beat from thence, have lighted there again.
About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,
Which lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.
She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind
Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,
Or warm or cool them, for they took delight
To play upon those hands, they were so white.
Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,
And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;
Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,
Such as the world would wonder to behold:
Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,
Which as she went, would chirrup through the bills.
Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,
And looking in her face, was strooken blind.
But this is true; so like was one the other,
As he imagin'd Hero was his mother;
And oftentimes into her bosom flew,
About her naked neck his bare arms threw,
And laid his childish head upon her breast,
And with still panting rock'd there took his rest.
So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,
As Nature wept, thinking she was undone,
Because she took more from her than she left,
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft:
Therefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,
Since Hero's time hath half the world been black.

         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young
(Whose tragedy divine Musus sung),
Dwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none
For whom succeeding times make greater moan.
His dangling tresses, that were never shorn,
Had they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,
Would have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece
To hazard more than for the golden fleece.
Fair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;
Grief makes her pale, because she moves not there.
His body was as straight as Circe's wand;
Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.
Even as delicious meat is to the taste,
So was his neck in touching, and surpast
The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,
How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;
And whose immortal fingers did imprint
That heavenly path with many a curious dint
That runs along his back; but my rude pen
Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men,
Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice
That my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;
Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his
That leapt into the water for a kiss
Of his own shadow, and, despising many,
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.
Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen,
Enamour'd of his beauty had he been.
His presence made the rudest peasant melt,
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt;
The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,
Was mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.
Some swore he was a maid in man's attire,
For in his looks were all that men desire,
A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,
A brow for love to banquet royally;
And such as knew he was a man, would say,
""Leander, thou art made for amorous play;
Why art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?
Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.""

         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,
For his sake whom their goddess held so dear,
Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.
Thither resorted many a wandering guest
To meet their loves; such as had none at all
Came lovers home from this great festival;
For every street, like to a firmament,
Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,
Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd
Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd
As if another Pha{""e}ton had got
The guidance of the sun's rich chariot.
But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,
And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;
For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,
So was her beauty to the standers-by;
Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star
(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car
From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,
Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,
She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood
Than she the hearts of those that near her stood.
Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,
Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,
Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain
From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,
So ran the people forth to gaze upon her,
And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.
And as in fury of a dreadful fight,
Their fellows being slain or put to flight,
Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,
So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,
Await the sentence of her scornful eyes;
He whom she favours lives; the other dies.
There might you see one sigh, another rage,
And some, their violent passions to assuage,
Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,
For faithful love will never turn to hate.
And many, seeing great princes were denied,
Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.
On this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!
Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower
To Venus' temple, where unhappily,
As after chanc'd, they did each other spy.
So fair a church as this had Venus none:
The walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,
Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head
A lively vine of green sea-agate spread,
Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,
And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.
Of crystal shining fair the pavement was;
The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:
There might you see the gods in sundry shapes,
Committing heady riots, incest, rapes:
For know, that underneath this radiant flower
Was Danae's statue in a brazen tower,
Jove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,
To dally with Idalian Ganimed,
And for his love Europa bellowing loud,
And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;
Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,
Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;
Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy
That now is turn'd into a cypress tree,
Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be.
And in the midst a silver altar stood:
There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,
Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;
And modestly they opened as she rose.
Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;
And thus Leander was enamoured.
Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,
Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed
Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:
Such force and virtue hath an amorous look.

         It lies not in our power to love or hate,
For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.
When two are stript, long ere the course begin,
We wish that one should lose, the other win;
And one especially do we affect
Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:
The reason no man knows, let it suffice,
What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.
Where both deliberate, the love is slight:
Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?",Hero and Leander,Love

But though I have found thee, and thou my thirst hast fed,
A holy thirsty dropsy melts me yet.
But why should I beg more love, whenas thou
Dost woo my soul, for hers off'ring all thine,
And dost not only fear lest I allow
My love to saints and angels, things divine,
But in thy tender jealousy dost doubt
Lest the world, flesh, yea devil put thee out.",Holy Sonnets: Since she whom I lov'd hath paid her last debt,Love

And nought I have, and all the world I season.
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison
And holdeth me notyet can I scape no wise
Nor letteth me live nor die at my device,
And yet of death it giveth me occasion.
Without eyen I see, and without tongue I plain.
I desire to perish, and yet I ask health.
I love another, and thus I hate myself.

Make thy self flutt'ring wings of thy fast flying
Thought, and fly forth unto my love, wheresoever she be:
Whether lying restless in heavy bed, or else
Sitting so cheerless at the cheerful board, or else
Playing alone careless on her heavenly virginals.
If in bed, tell her, that my eyes can take no rest:
If at board, tell her, that my mouth can eat no meat:
If at her virginals, tell her, I can hear no mirth.
Asked why? say: waking love suffereth no sleep:
Say that raging love doth appal the weak stomach:
Say, that lamenting love marreth the musical.
Tell her, that her pleasures were wont to lull me asleep:
Tell her, that her beauty was wont to feed mine eyes:
Tell her, that her sweet tongue was wont to make me mirth.
Now do I nightly waste, wanting my kindly rest:
Now do I daily starve, wanting my lively food:
Now do I always die, wanting thy timely mirth.
And if I waste, who will bewail my heavy chance?
And if I starve, who will record my cursed end?
And if I die, who will say: ""This was Immerito""?",Iambicum Trimetrum,Love
JOHN DONNE,"I can love both fair and brown,

JOHN DONNE,"Stand still, and I will read to thee
A lecture, love, in love's philosophy.
         These three hours that we have spent,
         Walking here, two shadows went
Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.
But, now the sun is just above our head,
         We do those shadows tread,
         And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.
So whilst our infant loves did grow,
Disguises did, and shadows, flow
From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so.
That love has not attain'd the high'st degree,
Which is still diligent lest others see.

Except our loves at this noon stay,
We shall new shadows make the other way.
         As the first were made to blind
         Others, these which come behind
Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.
If our loves faint, and westwardly decline,
         To me thou, falsely, thine,
         And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.
The morning shadows wear away,
But these grow longer all the day;
But oh, love's day is short, if love decay.
Love is a growing, or full constant light,
And his first minute, after noon, is night.",A Lecture upon the Shadow,Love
SIR THOMAS WYATT,"The longe love that in my thought doth harbour
And in mine hert doth keep his residence,
Into my face presseth with bold pretence
And therein campeth, spreading his banner.

And will that my trust and lustes negligence
Be rayned by reason, shame, and reverence,
With his hardiness taketh displeasure.
Wherewithall unto the hert's forest he fleeth,
Leaving his enterprise with pain and cry,
And there him hideth and not appeareth.

But in the field with him to live and die?
For good is the life ending faithfully.",The Long Love that in my Thought doth Harbour,Love
JOHN DONNE,"Some that have deeper digg'd love's mine than I,
Say, where his centric happiness doth lie;

I should not find that hidden mystery.
         Oh, 'tis imposture all!

      Who died before the god of love was born.
I cannot think that he, who then lov'd most,
      Sunk so low as to love one which did scorn.
But since this god produc'd a destiny,
And that vice-nature, custom, lets it be,
      I must love her, that loves not me.

   Sure, they which made him god, meant not so much,
      Nor he in his young godhead practis'd it.
But when an even flame two hearts did touch,
      His office was indulgently to fit
Actives to passives. Correspondency
Only his subject was; it cannot be
      Love, till I love her, that loves me.

   But every modern god will now extend
      His vast prerogative as far as Jove.
To rage, to lust, to write to, to commend,

To ungod this child again, it could not be
      I should love her, who loves not me.

   Rebel and atheist too, why murmur I,

Love might make me leave loving, or might try
      A deeper plague, to make her love me too;

O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
""Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
To march in ranks of better equipage:
But since he died and poets better prove,
Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.""",Sonnet 32: If thou survive my well-contented day,Love
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
With ugly rack on his celestial face
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace.
Even so my sun one early morn did shine
With all-triumphant splendour on my brow;
But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.",Sonnet 33: Full many a glorious morning have I seen,Love
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"What is your substance, whereof are you made,
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
Since every one hath, every one, one shade,
And you, but one, can every shadow lend.
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
Is poorly imitated after you;
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
And you in Grecian tires are painted new.
Speak of the spring and foison of the year:
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
The other as your bounty doth appear;
And you in every blessed shape we know.
    In all external grace you have some part,
    But you like none, none you, for constant heart.","Sonnet 53: What is your substance, whereof are you made",Love
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
When sometime lofty towers I see down-ras'd
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
And the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;
When I have seen such interchange of state,
Or state itself confounded to decay;
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
That Time will come and take my love away.
This thought is as a death, which cannot choose
But weep to have that which it fears to lose.",Sonnet 64: When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd,Love

As, to behold desert a beggar born,
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,
And strength by limping sway disabled,
And art made tongue-tied by authority,
And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,
And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
And captive good attending captain ill.
Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,
Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.","Sonnet 66: Tir'd with all these, for restful death I cry",Love

That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, 
If thinking on me then should make you woe.
O, if (I say) you look upon this verse,

Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west,
Which by and by black night doth take away,
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
As the death-bed whereon it must expire,
Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.
This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
To love that well which thou must leave ere long.",Sonnet 73: That time of year thou mayst in me behold,Love

And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,
Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes;
And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.","Sonnet 107: Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul",Love

And made myself a motley to the view,
Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
Made old offences of affections new.
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
Askance and strangely: but, by all above,
These blenches gave my heart another youth,
And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.
Now all is done, have what shall have no end!
Mine appetite, I never more will grind
On newer proof, to try an older friend,
A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.

Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.","Sonnet 110: Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there",Love

It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come;

Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?

JOHN DONNE,"As virtuous men pass mildly away,
   And whisper to their souls to go,
Whilst some of their sad friends do say
   The breath goes now, and some say, No:

So let us melt, and make no noise,
   No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;
'Twere profanation of our joys
   To tell the laity our love.

Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears,
   Men reckon what it did, and meant;
But trepidation of the spheres,
   Though greater far, is innocent.

Dull sublunary lovers' love
   (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit
Absence, because it doth remove
   Those things which elemented it.

But we by a love so much refined,
   That our selves know not what it is,
Inter-assured of the mind,
   Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.

Our two souls therefore, which are one,
   Though I must go, endure not yet
A breach, but an expansion,
   Like gold to airy thinness beat.

If they be two, they are two so
   As stiff twin compasses are two;
Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show
   To move, but doth, if the other do.

And though it in the center sit,
   Yet when the other far doth roam,
It leans and hearkens after it,
   And grows erect, as that comes home.

Such wilt thou be to me, who must,
   Like th' other foot, obliquely run;
Thy firmness makes my circle just,
   And makes me end where I begun.",A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning,Love

For thy face coins them, and thy stamp they bear,
And by this mintage they are something worth,
         For thus they be
         Pregnant of thee;
Fruits of much grief they are, emblems of more,
When a tear falls, that thou falls which it bore,
So thou and I are nothing then, when on a diverse shore.

         On a round ball
A workman that hath copies by, can lay
An Europe, Afric, and an Asia,

A globe, yea world, by that impression grow,
Till thy tears mix'd with mine do overflow
This world; by waters sent from thee, my heaven dissolved so.

Draw not up seas to drown me in thy sphere,

LORD BYRON," There was a sound of revelry by night,
    And Belgium's capital had gathered then
    Her beauty and her chivalry, and bright
    The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;
    A thousand hearts beat happily; and when
    Music arose with its voluptuous swell,
    Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,
    And all went merry as a marriage-bell;
  But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!

    Did ye not hear it?--No; 'twas but the wind,
    Or the car rattling o'er the stony street;
    On with the dance! let joy be unconfined!
    No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet
    To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet,--
    But hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more,
    As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
    And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!
  Arm! arm! it is--it is--the cannon's opening roar!

    Within a windowed niche of that high hall
    Sate Brunswick's fated chieftain; he did hear
    That sound the first amidst the festival,
    And caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;
    And when they smiled because he deemed it near,
    His heart more truly knew that peal too well
    Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,
    And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell:
  He rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.

    Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,
    And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,
    And cheeks all pale which but an hour ago
    Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness;
    And there were sudden partings, such as press
    The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
    Which ne'er might be repeated: who would guess
    If evermore should meet those mutual eyes
  Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise!

    And there was mounting in hot haste: the steed,
    The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,
    Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,
    And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;
    And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;
    And near, the beat of the alarming drum
    Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;
    While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,
  Or whispering with white lips,--""The foe! they come! they come!""

    And wild and high the ""Cameron's gathering"" rose,
    The war-note of Lochiel, which Albyn's hills
    Have heard,--and heard, too, have her Saxon foes:
    How in the noon of night that pibroch thrills
    Savage and shrill! But with the breath which fills
    Their mountain pipe, so fill the mountaineers
    With the fierce native daring which instills
    The stirring memory of a thousand years,
  And Evan's, Donald's fame, rings in each clansman's ears!

    And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,
    Dewy with nature's tear-drops, as they pass,
    Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,
    Over the unreturning brave,--alas!
    Ere evening to be trodden like the grass
    Which now beneath them, but above shall grow
    In its next verdure, when this fiery mass
    Of living valor, rolling on the foe,
  And burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low.

    Last noon beheld them full of lusty life,
    Last eve in Beauty's circle proudly gay,
    The midnight brought the signal sound of strife,
    The morn the marshalling in arms,--the day
    Battle's magnificently stern array!
    The thunder-clouds close o'er it, which when rent
    The earth is covered thick with other clay,
    Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,
  Rider and horse,--friend, foe,--in one red burial blent!

    Their praise is hymned by loftier harps than mine;
    Yet one I would select from that proud throng,
    Partly because they blend me with his line,
    And partly that I did his sire some wrong,
    And partly that bright names will hallow song!
    And his was of the bravest, and when showered
    The death-bolts deadliest the thinned files along,
    Even where the thickest of war's tempest lowered,
  They reached no nobler breast than thine, young, gallant Howard!

    There have been tears and breaking hearts for thee,
    And mine were nothing, had I such to give;
    But when I stood beneath the fresh green tree,
    Which living waves where thou didst cease to live,
    And saw around me the wide field revive
    With fruits and fertile promise, and the Spring
    Come forth her work of gladness to contrive,
    With all her reckless birds upon the wing,
  I turned from all she brought to those she could not bring.

    I turned to thee, to thousands, of whom each
    And one as all a ghastly gap did make
    In his own kind and kindred, whom to teach
    Forgetfulness were mercy for their sake;
    The Archangel's trump, not glory's, must awake
    Those whom they thirst for; though the sound of Fame
    May for a moment soothe, it cannot slake
    The fever of vain longing, and the name
  So honored but assumes a stronger, bitterer claim.

    They mourn, but smile at length; and, smiling, mourn:
    The tree will wither long before it fall;
    The hull drives on, though mast and sail be torn;
    The roof-tree sinks, but moulders on the hall
    In massy hoariness; the ruined wall
    Stands when its wind-worn battlements are gone;
    The bars survive the captive they enthrall;
    The day drags through though storms keep out the sun;
  And thus the heart will break, yet brokenly live on;

    Even as a broken mirror, which the glass
    In every fragment multiplies, and makes
    A thousand images of one that was
    The same, and still the more, the more it breaks;
    And thus the heart will do which not forsakes,
    Living in shattered guise, and still, and cold,
    And bloodless, with its sleepless sorrow aches,
    Yet withers on till all without is old,
  Showing no visible sign, for such things are untold.",WATERLOO,WAR

  Reason clear in thought and brain
  Till the morning comes again;
  Till the third dread morning tell

ROBERT T.S. LOWELL.," O, that last day in Lucknow fort!
    We knew that it was the last;
  That the enemy's lines crept surely on.
    And the end was coming fast.

  To yield to that foe meant worse than death;
    And the men and we all worked on;
  It was one day more of smoke and roar,
    And then it would all be done.

  There was one of us, a corporal's wife,
    A fair, young, gentle thing,
  Wasted with fever in the siege.
    And her mind was wandering.

  She lay on the ground, in her Scottish plaid,
    And I took her head on my knee;
  ""When my father comes hame frae the pleugh,"" she said,
    ""Oh! then please wauken me.""

  She slept like a child on her father's floor,
    In the flecking of woodbine-shade,
  When the house-dog sprawls by the open door,
    And the mother's wheel is stayed.

  It was smoke and roar and powder-stench,
    And hopeless waiting for death;
  And the soldier's wife, like a full-tired child,
    Seemed scarce to draw her breath.

  I sank to sleep; and I had my dream
    Of an English village-lane.
  And wall and garden;--but one wild scream
    Brought me back to the roar again.

  There Jessie Brown stood listening
    Till a sudden gladness broke
  All over her face; and she caught my hand
    And drew me near as she spoke:--

  ""The Hielanders! O, dinna ye hear
    The slogan far awa,
  The McGregor's?--O, I ken it weel;
    It's the grandest o' them a'!

  ""God bless thae bonny Hielanders!
    We're saved! we're saved!"" she cried;
  And fell on her knees; and thanks to God
    Flowed forth like a full flood-tide.

  Along the battery-line her cry
    Had fallen among the men,
  And they started back;--they were there to die;
    But was life so near them, then?

  They listened for life; the rattling fire
    Far off, and the far-off roar,
  Were all; and the colonel shook his head,
    And they turned to their guns once more.

  But Jessie said, ""The slogan's done;
    But winna ye hear it noo,
  _The Campbells are comin'_? It's no' a dream;
    Our succors hae broken through!""

  We heard the roar and the rattle afar,
    But the pipes we could not hear;
  So the men plied their work of hopeless war
    And knew that the end was near.

  It was not long ere it made its way,--
    A thrilling, ceaseless sound:
  It was no noise from the strife afar,
    Or the sappers under ground.

  It _was_ the pipes of the Highlanders!
    And now they played _Auld Lang Syne;_
  It came to our men like the voice of God,
    And they shouted along the line.

  And they wept, and shook one another's hands,
    And the women sobbed in a crowd;
  And every one knelt down where he stood,
    And we all thanked God aloud.

  That happy day, when we welcomed them,
    Our men put Jessie first;
  And the general gave her his hand, and cheers
    Like a storm from the soldiers burst.

  And the pipers' ribbons and tartan streamed,
    Marching round and round our line;
  And our joyful cheers were broken with tears,
    As the pipes played _Auld Long Syne_.",THE RELIEF OF LUCKNOW.,WAR

    Their voices in their chieftain's praise.
    Each boatman, bending to his oar,
    With measured sweep the burthen bore,
    In such wild cadence, as the breeze
    Makes through December's leafless trees.
    The chorus first could Allen know,

    Distinct the martial ditty flowed.

SIR WALTER SCOTT.,"There is no breeze upon the fern,
    No ripple on the lake,
  Upon her eyrie nods the erne,
    The deer has sought the brake;
  The small birds will not sing aloud,
    The springing trout lies still,
  So darkly glooms yon thunder-cloud,
  That swathes, as with a purple shroud,
    Benledi's distant hill.
  Is it the thunder's solemn sound
    That mutters deep and dread,
  Or echoes from the groaning ground
    The warrior's measured tread?
  Is it the lightning's quivering glance
    That on the thicket streams,
  Or do they flash on spear and lance
    The sun's retiring beams?
  I see the dagger crest of Mar,
    I see the Moray's silver star
  Wave o'er the cloud of Saxon war,
    That up the lake comes winding far!
  To hero bound for battle strife,
    Or bard of martial lay,
  'Twere worth ten years of peaceful life,
    One glance at their array!

  Their light-armed archers far and near
    Surveyed the tangled ground,
  Their centre ranks, with pike and spear,
    A twilight forest frowned,
  Their barbèd horsemen, in the rear,
    The stern battalia crowned.
  No cymbal clashed, no clarion rang,
    Still were the pipe and drum;
  Save heavy tread, and armor's clang,
    The sullen march was dumb.
  There breathed no wind their crests to shake,
    Or wave their flags abroad;
  Scarce the frail aspen seemed to quake,
    That shadowed o'er their road.
  Their vaward scouts no tidings bring,
    Can rouse no lurking foe,
  Nor spy a trace of living thing,
    Save when they stirred the roe;
  The host moves like a deep sea wave,
  Where rise no rocks its pride to brave,
    High swelling, dark, and slow.
  The lake is passed, and now they gain
  A narrow and a broken plain,
  Before the Trosach's rugged jaws;
  And here the horse and spearmen pause,
  While, to explore the dangerous glen,
  Dive through the pass the archer men.

  At once there rose so wild a yell
  Within that dark and narrow dell.
  As all the fiends, from heaven that fell,
  Had pealed the banner cry of hell!
  Forth from the pass in tumult driven,
  Like chaff before the winds of heaven,
    The archery appear:
  For life! for life! their flight they ply--
  And shriek, and shout, and battle-cry,
  And plaids and bonnets waving high,
  And broadswords flashing to the sky,
    Are maddening in the rear.
  Onward they drive, in dreadful race,
    Pursuers and pursued;
  Before that tide of flight and chase,
  How shall it keep its rooted place,
    The spearmen's twilight wood?
  --""Down, down,"" cried Mar, ""your lances down!
    Bear back both friend and foe!""
  Like reeds before the tempest's frown,
  That serried grove of lances brown
    At once lay levelled low;
  And closely shouldering side to side,
  The bristling ranks the onset bide.--
  --""We'll quell the savage mountaineer,
    As their Tinchel[A] cows the game;
  They come as fleet as forest deer,
    We'll drive them back as tame.""

  Bearing before them, in their course,
  The relics of the archer force,
  Like wave with crest of sparkling foam,
  Right onward did Clan-Alpine come.
  Above the tide, each broadsword bright
  Was brandishing like beam of light,
    Each targe was dark below;
  And with the ocean's mighty swing,
  When heaving to the tempest's wing,
    They hurled them on the foe.

  I heard the lance's shivering crash,
  As when the whirlwind rends the ash;
  I heard the broadsword's deadly clang,
  As if a hundred anvils rang!
  But Moray wheeled his rearward flank--
  Of horsemen on Clan-Alpine's flank--
    ""My bannerman, advance!
  I see,"" he cried, ""their columns shake.
  Now, gallants! for your ladies' sake,
    Upon them with the lance!""
  The horsemen dashed among the rout,
    As deer break through the broom;
  Their steeds are stout, their swords are out,
    They soon make lightsome room.
  Clan-Alpine's best are backward borne--
    Where, where was Roderick then?
  One blast upon his bugle-horn
    Were worth a thousand men!
  And refluent through the pass of fear
    The battle's tide was poured;
  Vanished the Saxon's struggling spear,
    Vanished the mountain sword.
  As Bracklinn's chasm, so black and steep,
    Receives her roaring linn,
  As the dark caverns of the deep
    Suck the wild whirlpool in,
  So did the deep and darksome pass
  Devour the battle's mingled mass;

  These cowls of Kilmarnock had spits and had spears,
  And lang-hafted gullies to kill cavaliers;
  But they shrunk to close-heads, and the causeway was free

OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES,"he has gone,--she has left us in passion and pride--
  Our stormy-browed sister, so long at our side!
  She has torn her own star from our firmament's glow,
  And turned on her brother the face of a foe!

  O Caroline, Caroline, child of the sun,
  We can never forget that our hearts have been one,--
  Our foreheads both sprinkled in Liberty's name,
  From the fountain of blood with the finger of flame!

  You were always too ready to fire at a touch;
  But we said: ""She is hasty--she does not mean much.""
  We have scowled when you uttered some turbulent threat;
  But friendship still whispered: ""Forgive and forget.""

  Has our love all died out? Have its altars grown cold?
  Has the curse come at last which the fathers foretold?
  Then Nature must teach us the strength of the chain
  That her petulant children would sever in vain.

  They may fight till the buzzards are gorged with their spoil,--
  Till the harvest grows black as it rots in the soil,
  Till the wolves and the catamounts troop from their caves,
  And the shark tracks the pirate, the lord of the waves:

  In vain is the strife! When its fury is past,
  Their fortunes must flow in one channel at last,
  As the torrents that rush from the mountains of snow
  Roll mingled in peace in the valleys below.

  Our Union is river, lake, ocean, and sky;
  Man breaks not the medal when God cuts the die!
  Though darkened with sulphur, though cloven with steel,
  The blue arch will brighten, the waters will heal!

  O Caroline, Caroline, child of the sun,
  There are battles with fate that can never be won!
  The star-flowering banner must never be furled,
  For its blossoms of light are the hope of the world!

  Go, then, our rash sister, afar and aloof,--
  Run wild in the sunshine away from our roof;

WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS,"The colonel rode by his picket-line
    In the pleasant morning sun,
  That glanced from him far off to shine
    On the crouching rebel picket's gun.

  From his command the captain strode
    Out with a grave salute,
  And talked with the colonel as he rode:--
    The picket levelled his piece to shoot.

  The colonel rode and the captain walked,--
    The arm of the picket tired;
  Their faces almost touched as they talked,
    And, swerved from his aim, the picket fired.

  The captain fell at the horse's feet,
    Wounded and hurt to death,
  Calling upon a name that was sweet
    As God is good, with his dying breath.

  And the colonel that leaped from his horse and knelt
    To close the eyes so dim,
  A high remorse for God's mercy felt,
    Knowing the shot was meant for him.

  And he whispered, prayer-like, under his breath,
    The name of his own young wife:
  For Love, that had made his friend's peace with Death,
    Alone could make his with life.

EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN,"So that soldierly legend is still on its journey,--
    That story of Kearny who knew not to yield!
  'Twas the day when with Jameson, fierce Berry, and Birney,
    Against twenty thousand he rallied the field.
  Where the red volleys poured, where the clamor rose highest,
    Where the dead lay in clumps through the dwarf oak and pine,
  Where the aim from the thicket was surest and nighest,--
    No charge like Phil Kearny's along the whole line.

  When the battle went ill, and the bravest were solemn,
    Near the dark Seven Pines, where we still held our ground,
  He rode down the length of the withering column,
    And his heart at our war-cry leapt up with a bound;
  He snuffed, like his charger, the wind of the powder,--
    His sword waved us on and we answered the sign:
  Loud our cheer as we rushed, but his laugh rang the louder,
    ""There's the devil's own fun, boys, along the whole line!""

  How he strode his brown steed! How we saw his blade brighten
    In the one hand still left,--and the reins in his teeth!
  He laughed like a boy when the holidays heighten.
    But a soldier's glance shot from his visor beneath.
  Up came the reserves to the mellay infernal,
    Asking where to go in,--through the clearing or pine?
  ""O, anywhere! Forward! 'Tis all the same, Colonel:
    You'll find lovely fighting along the whole line!""

  O, evil the black shroud of night at Chantilly,
    That hid him from sight of his brave men and tried!
  Foul, foul sped the bullet that clipped the white lily,
    The flower of our knighthood, the whole army's pride!
  Yet we dream that he still,--in that shadowy region
    Where the dead form their ranks at the wan drummer's sign,--
  Rides on, as of old, down the length of his legion,

",DIRGE FOB A SOLDIER,WAR
FRANK H. GASSAWAY,"Twas the last fight at Fredericksburg,--
    Perhaps the day you reck,
  Our boys, the Twenty-Second Maine,
    Kept Early's men in check.
  Just where Wade Hampton boomed away
    The fight went neck and neck.

  All day the weaker wing we held,
    And held it with a will.
  Five several stubborn times we charged
    The battery on the hill,
  And five times beaten back, re-formed,
    And kept our column still.

  At last from out the centre fight
    Spurred up a general's aide:
  ""That battery must silenced be!""
    He cried, as past he sped.
  Our colonel simply touched his cap,
    And then, with measured tread,

  To lead the crouching line once more
    The grand old fellow came.
  No wounded man but raised his head
    And strove to gasp his name,
  And those who could not speak nor stir,
    ""God blessed him"" just the same.

  For he was all the world to us,
    That hero gray and grim.
  Right well we knew that fearful slope
    We'd climb with none but him,
  Though while his white head led the way
    We'd charge hell's portals in.

  This time we were not half-way up.
    When, midst the storm of shell,
  Our leader, with his sword upraised,
    Beneath our bayonets fell.
  And, as we bore him back, the foe
    Set up a joyous yell.

  Our hearts went with him. Back we swept,
    And when the bugle said
  ""Up, charge again!"" no man was there
    But hung his dogged head.
  ""We've no one left to lead us now,""
    The sullen soldiers said.

  Just then before the laggard line
    The colonel's horse we spied,
  Bay Billy with his trappings on,
    His nostrils swelling wide,
  As though still on his gallant back
    The master sat astride.

  Right royally he took the place
    That was of old his wont,
  And with a neigh that seemed to say,
    Above the battle's brunt,
  ""How can the Twenty-Second charge
    If I am not in front?""

  Like statues rooted there we stood,
    And gazed a little space,
  Above that floating mane we missed
    The dear familiar face,
  But we saw Bay Billy's eye of fire,
    And it gave us heart of grace.

  No bugle-call could rouse us all
    As that brave sight had done,
  Down all the battered line we felt
    A lightning impulse run.
  Up! up the hill we followed Bill,--
    And we captured every gun!

  And when upon the conquered height
    Died out the battle's hum,
  Vainly mid living and the dead
    We sought our leader dumb.
  It seemed as if a spectre steed
    To win that day had come.

  And then the dusk and dew of night
    Fell softly o'er the plain,
  As though o'er man's dread work of death
    The angels wept again,
  And drew night's curtain gently round
    A thousand beds of pain.

  All night the surgeons' torches went,
    The ghastly rows between,--
  All night with solemn step I paced
    The torn and bloody green.
  But who that fought in the big war
    Such dread sights have not seen?

  At last the morning broke. The lark
    Sang in the merry skies,
  As if to e'en the sleepers there
    It bade awake, and rise!
  Though naught but that last trump of all
    Could ope their heavy eyes.

  And then once more with banners gay,
    Stretched out the long brigade.
  Trimly upon the furrowed field
    The troops stood on parade,
  And bravely mid the ranks were closed
    The gaps the fight had made.

  Not half the Twenty-Second's men
    Were in their place that morn;
  And Corporal Dick, who yester-noon
    Stood six brave fellows on,
  Now touched my elbow in the ranks,
    For all between were gone.

  Ah I who forgets that dreary hour
    When, as with misty eyes,
  To call the old familiar roll
    The solemn sergeant tries,--
  One feels that thumping of the heart
    As no prompt voice replies.

  And as in faltering tone and slow
    The last few names were said,
  Across the field some missing horse
    Toiled up the weary tread.
  It caught the sergeant's eye, and quick
    Bay Billy's name he read.

  Yes! there the old bay hero stood,
    All safe from battle's harms,
  And ere an order could be heard,
    Or the bugle's quick alarms,
  Down all the front, from end to end,
    The troops presented arms!

  Not all the shoulder-straps on earth
    Could still our mighty cheer;
  And ever from that famous day,
    When rang the roll call clear,
  Bay Billy's name was read, and then
    The whole line answered, ""Here!""",BAY BILLY,WAR

",WHEN THIS CRUEL WAR IS OVER,WAR
THOMAS BUCHANAN READ,"
  Up from the South at break of day,
  Bringing to Winchester fresh dismay,
  The affrighted air with a shudder bore,
  Like a herald in haste, to the chieftain's door,
  The terrible grumble and rumble and roar,
  Telling the battle was on once more,
  And Sheridan twenty miles away.

  And wider still those billows of war
  Thundered along the horizon's bar;
  And louder yet into Winchester rolled
  The roar of that red sea uncontrolled,
  Making the blood of the listener cold
  As he thought of the stake in that fiery fray,
  With Sheridan twenty miles away.

  But there is a road from Winchester town,
  A good, broad highway, leading down;
  And there, through the flash of the morning light,
  A steed as black as the steeds of night
  Was seen to pass as with eagle flight.
  As if he knew the terrible need,
  He stretched away with the utmost speed;
  Hills rose and fell,--but his heart was gay,
  With Sheridan fifteen miles away.

  Still sprung from those swift hoofs, thundering South,
  The dust, like smoke from the cannon's mouth;
  Or the trail of a comet, sweeping faster and faster,
  Foreboding to traitors the doom of disaster.
  The heart of the steed and the heart of the master
  Were beating, like prisoners assaulting their walls.
  Impatient to be where the battle-field calls;
  Every nerve of the charger was strained to full play,
  With Sheridan only ten miles away.

  Under his spurning feet, the road
  Like an arrowy Alpine river flowed,
  And the landscape sped away behind,
  Like an ocean flying before the wind;
  And the steed, like a bark fed with furnace ire,
  Swept on, with his wild eyes full of fire;
  But, lo! he is nearing his heart's desire,
  He is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray,
  With Sheridan only five miles away.

  The first that the General saw were the groups
  Of stragglers, and then the retreating troops;
  What was done,--what to do,--a glance told him both,
  And, striking his spurs with a terrible oath,
  He dashed down the line mid a storm of huzzas,
  And the wave of retreat checked its course there, because
  The sight of the master compelled it to pause.
  With foam and with dust the black charger was gray;
  By the flash of his eye, and his nostril's play,
  He seemed to the whole great army to say,
  ""I have brought you Sheridan all the way
  From Winchester down, to save the day!""

  Hurrah, hurrah for Sheridan!
  Hurrah, hurrah, for horse and man!
  And when their statues are placed on high,
  Under the dome of the Union sky,--
  The American soldier's Temple of Fame,--
  There with the glorious General's name
  Be it said in letters both bold and bright:
  ""Here is the steed that saved the day
  By carrying Sheridan into the fight,
  From Winchester,--twenty miles away!""",SHERIDAN'S RIDE,WAR
SARAH TITTLE BOLTON," What, was it a dream? am I all alone
    In the dreary night and the drizzling rain?
  Hist!--ah, it was only the river's moan;
    They have left me behind with the mangled slain.

  Yes, now I remember it all too well!
    We met, from the battling ranks apart;
  Together our weapons Hashed and fell,
    And mine was sheathed in his quivering heart.

  In the cypress gloom, where the deed was done,
    It was all too dark to see his face;
  But I heard his death-groans, one by one,
    And he holds me still in a cold embrace.

  He spoke but once, and I could not hear
    The words he said for the cannon's roar;
  But my heart grew cold with a deadly fear,--
    God! I had heard that voice before!

  Had heard it before at our mother's knee,
    When we lisped the words of our evening prayer!
  My brother! would I had died for thee,--
    This burden is more than my soul can bear!

  I pressed my lips to his death-cold cheek,
    And begged him to show me, by word or sign,
  That he knew and forgave me: he could not speak,
    But he nestled his poor cold face to mine.

  The blood flowed fast from my wounded side,
    And then for a while I forgot my pain,
  And over the lakelet we seemed to glide
    In our little boat, two boys again.

  And then, in my dream, we stood alone
    On a forest path where the shadows fell;
  And I heard again the tremulous tone,
    And the tender words of his last farewell.

  But that parting was years, long years ago,
    He wandered away to a foreign land;
  And our dear old mother will never know
    That he died to-night by his brother's hand.

  The soldiers who buried the dead away
    Disturbed not the clasp of that last embrace,
  But laid them to sleep till the judgment-day,
    Heart folded to heart, and face to face.",LEFT ON THE BATTLE-FIELD,WAR

  Breathe, trumpets, breathe
    Slow notes of saddest wailing,--
  Sadly responsive peal, ye muffled drums;
  Comrades, with downcast eyes
      And banners trailing,
      Attend him home,--
  The youthful warrior comes.

  Upon his shield,
    Upon his shield returning,
  Borne from the field of honor
    Where he fell;
  Glory and grief, together clasped
    In mourning,
  His fame, his fate
    With sobs exulting tell.

  Wrap round his breast
    The flag his breast defended,--
  His country's flag,
    In battle's front unrolled:
  For it he died;
    On earth forever ended
  His brave young life
    Lives in each sacred fold.
  With proud fond tears,
    By tinge of shame untainted,
  Bear him, and lay him

FOR ONE SLAIN IN BATTLE",WAR
JOHN RANDOLPH THOMPSON,"Two armies covered hill and plain,
    Where Rappahannock's waters
  Ran deeply crimsoned with the stain
    Of battle's recent slaughters.

  The summer clouds lay pitched like tents
    In meads of heavenly azure;
  And each dread gun of the elements
    Slept in its embrasure.

  The breeze so softly blew, it made
    No forest leaf to quiver,
  And the smoke of the random cannonade
    Rolled slowly from the river.

  And now, where circling hills looked down
    With cannon grimly planted,
  O'er listless camp and silent town
    The golden sunset slanted.

  When on the fervid air there came
    A strain--now rich, now tender;
  The music seemed itself aflame
    With day's departing splendor.

  A Federal band, which, eve and morn,
    Played measures brave and nimble,
  Had just struck up, with flute and horn
    And lively clash of cymbal.

  Down flocked the soldiers to the banks,
    Till, margined by its pebbles,
  One wooded shore was blue with ""Yanks,""
    And one was gray with ""Rebels.""

  Then all was still, and then the band,
    With movements light and tricksy,
  Made stream and forest, hill and strand,
    Reverberate with ""Dixie.""

  The conscious stream with burnished glow
    Went proudly o'er its pebbles,
  But thrilled throughout its deepest flow
    With yelling of the Rebels.

  Again a pause, and then again
    The trumpets pealed sonorous,
  And ""Yankee Doodle"" was the strain
    To which the shore gave chorus.

  The laughing ripple shoreward flew,
    To kiss the shining pebbles;
  Loud shrieked the swarming Boys in Blue
    Defiance to the Rebels.

  And yet once more the bugle sang
    Above the stormy riot;
  No shout upon the evening rang--
    There reigned a holy quiet.

  The sad, slow stream its noiseless flood
    Poured o'er the glistening pebbles;
  All silent now the Yankees stood,
    And silent stood the Rebels.

  No unresponsive soul had heard
    That plaintive note's appealing,
  So deeply ""Home, Sweet Home"" had stirred
    The hidden fount of feeling.

  Or Blue, or Gray, the soldier sees,
    As by the wand of fairy,
  The cottage 'neath the live-oak trees,
    The cabin by the prairie.

  Or cold, or warm, his native skies,
    Bend in their beauty o'er him;
  Seen through the tear-mist in his eyes,
    His loved ones stand before him.

  As fades the iris after rain
    In April's tearful weather,
  The vision vanished, as the strain
    And daylight died together.

  But memory, waked by music's art,
    Expressed in simplest numbers,
  Subdued the sternest Yankee's heart,
    Made light the Rebel's slumbers.

  And fair the form of Music shines,
    That bright celestial creature.

GEORGE ALFRED TOWNSEND,"Ho! pony. Down the lonely road
    Strike now your cheeriest pace!
  The woods on fire do not burn higher
    Than burns my anxious face;
  Far have you sped, but all this night
    Must feel my nervous spur;
  If we be late, the world must wait
    The tidings we aver:--
  To home and hamlet, town and hearth,
    To thrill child, mother, man,
  I carry to the waiting North
    Great news from Sheridan!

  The birds are dead among the pines,
    Slain by the battle fright,
  Prone in the road the steed reclines
    That never readied the fight;
  Yet on we go,--the wreck below
    Of many a tumbled wain,--
  By ghastly pools where stranded mules
    Die, drinking of the rain;
  With but my list of killed and missed
    I spur my stumbling nag,
  To tell of death at many a tryst,
    But victory to the flag!

  ""Halt! who comes there? The countersign!""--
    ""A friend.""--""Advance! The fight,--
  How goes it, say?""--""We won the day!""--
    ""Huzza! Pass on!""--""Good-night!""--
  And parts the darkness on before,
    And down the mire we tramp,
  And the black sky is painted o'er
    With many a pulsing camp;
  O'er stumps and ruts, by ruined huts,
    Where ghosts look through the gloam,--
  Behind my tread I hear the dead
    Follow the news toward home!

  The hunted souls I see behind,
    In swamp and in ravine,
  Whose cry for mercy thrills the wind
    Till cracks the sure carbine;
  The moving lights, which scare the dark,
    And show the trampled place
  Where, in his blood, some mother's bud
    Turns up his young, dead face;
  The captives spent, whose standards rent
    The conqueror parades,
  As at the Five Forks roads arrive
    The General's dashing aides.

  O wondrous Youth! through this grand ruth
    Runs my boy's life its thread;
  The General's fame, the battle's name,
    The rolls of maimed and dead
  I bear, with my thrilled soul astir,
    And lonely thoughts and fears;
  And am but History's courier
    To bind the conquering years;
  A battle-ray, through ages gray
    To light to deeds sublime,
  And flash the lustre of this day
   Down all the aisles of Time!

  Ho! pony,--'tis the signal gun
    The night-assault decreed;
  On Petersburg the thunderbolts
    Crash from the lines of Meade;
  Fade the pale, frightened stars o'erhead,
    And shrieks the bursting air;
  The forest foliage, tinted red,
    Grows ghastlier in the glare;
  Though in her towers, reached her last hours,
    Rocks proud Rebellion's crest--
  The world may sag, if but my nag
    Get in before the rest!

  With bloody flank, and fetlocks dank,
    And goad, and lash, and shout--
  Great God! as every hoof-beat falls
    A hundred lives beat out!
  As weary as this broken steed
    Reels down the corduroys,
  So, weary, fight for morning light
    Our hot and grimy boys;
  Through ditches wet, o'er parapet
    And guns barbette, they catch
  The last, lost breach; and I,--I reach

  Sure it shall speed, the land to read,
    As sped the happiest shell!
  The shot I send strike the world's end;

THOMAS BUCHANAN READ,"Within the sober realm of leafless trees,
    The russet year inhaled the dreamy air;
  Like some tanned reaper, in his hour of ease,
    When all the fields are lying brown and bare.

  The gray barns looking from their hazy hills,
    O'er the dun waters widening in the vales,
  Sent down the air a greeting to the mills
    On the dull thunder of alternate flails.

  All sights were mellowed and all sounds subdued,
    The hills seemed further and the stream sang low,
  As in a dream the distant woodman hewed
    His winter log with many a muffled blow.

  The embattled forests, erewhile armed with gold,
    Their banners bright with every martial hue,
  Now stood like some sad, beaten host of old,
    Withdrawn afar in Time's remotest blue.

  On slumb'rous wings the vulture held his flight;
    The dove scarce heard its sighing mate's complaint;
  And, like a star slow drowning in the light,
    The village church-vane seemed to pale and faint.

  The sentinel-cock upon the hillside crew,--
    Crew thrice,--and all was stiller than before;
  Silent, till some replying warden blew
    His alien horn, and then was heard no more.

  Where erst the jay, within the elm's tall crest,
    Made garrulous trouble round her unfledged young;
  And where the oriole hung her swaying nest,
    By every light wind like a censer swung;--

  Where sang the noisy martens of the eaves,
    The busy swallows circling ever near,--
  Foreboding, as the rustic mind believes,
    An early harvest and a plenteous year;--

  Where every bird which charmed the vernal feast
    Shook the sweet slumber from its wings at morn,
  To warn the reaper of the rosy east:--
    All now was sunless, empty, and forlorn.

  Alone from out the stubble piped the quail,
    And croaked the crow through all the dreamy gloom;
  Alone the pheasant, drumming in the vale,
    Made echo to the distant cottage-loom.

  There was no bud, no bloom upon the bowers;
    The spiders moved their thin shrouds night by night,
  The thistle-down, the only ghost of flowers,
    Sailed slowly by,--passed noiseless out of sight.

  Amid all this--in this most cheerless air,
    And where the woodbine shed upon the porch
  Its crimson leaves, as if the Year stood there
    Firing the floor with his inverted torch,--

  Amid all this, the centre of the scene,
    The white-haired matron with monotonous tread
  Plied the swift wheel, and with her joyless mien
    Sat, like a fate, and watched the flying thread,

  She had known Sorrow,--he had walked with her,
    Oft supped, and broke the bitter ashen crust;
  And in the dead leaves still she heard the stir
    Of his black mantle trailing in the dust.

  While yet her cheek was bright with summer bloom,
    Her country summoned and she gave her all;
  And twice War bowed to her his sable plume,--
    Re-gave the swords to rust upon the wall.

  Re-gave the swords, but not the hand that drew
    And struck for Liberty the dying blow;
  Nor him who, to his sire and country true,
    Fell mid the ranks of the invading foe.

  Long, but not loud, the droning wheel went on,
    Like the low murmur of a hive at noon;
  Long, but not loud, the memory of the gone
    Breathed through her lips a sad and tremulous tune.

  At last the thread was snapped; her head was bowed;
    Life dropt the distaff through his hands serene;
  And loving neighbors smoothed her careful shroud,
    While Death and Winter closed the autumn scene",THE CLOSING SCENE,WAR

  To hand-breadth size; the huge abhorrence shrank
  Into the form and fashion of a dove;

CHARLES MACKAY,"Old Tubal Cain was a man of might,
    In the days when earth was young;
  By the fierce red light of his furnace bright,
    The strokes of his hammer rung:
  And he lifted high his brawny hand
    On the iron glowing clear,
  Till the sparks rushed out in scarlet showers,
    As he fashioned the sword and the spear.
  And he sang: ""Hurrah for my handiwork!
    Hurrah for the spear and the sword!
  Hurrah for the hand that shall wield them well,
    For he shall be king and lord.""

  To Tubal Cain came many a one,
    As he wrought by his roaring fire,
  And each one prayed for a strong steel blade
    As the crown of his desire:
  And he made them weapons sharp and strong,
    Till they shouted loud for glee,
  And gave him gifts of pearl and gold,
    And spoils of the forest free.
  And they sang: ""Hurrah for Tubal Cain,
    Who hath given us strength anew!
  Hurrah for the smith, hurrah for the fire,
    And hurrah for the metal true!""

  But a sudden change came o'er his heart,
    Ere the setting of the sun,
  And Tubal Cain was filled with pain
    For the evil he had done;
  He saw that men, with rage and hate,
    Made war upon their kind,
  That the land was red with the blood they shed,
    In their lust for carnage blind.
  And he said: ""Alas! that ever I made,
    Or that skill of mine should plan,
  The spear and the sword for men whose joy
    Is to slay their fellow-man!""

  And for many a day old Tubal Cain
    Sat brooding o'er his woe;
  And his hand forbore to smite the ore,
    And his furnace smouldered low.
  But he rose at last with a cheerful face,
    And a bright courageous eye,
  And bared his strong right arm for work,
    While the quick flames mounted high.
  And he sang: ""Hurrah for my handiwork!""
    And the red sparks lit the air;
  ""Not alone for the blade was the bright steel made,""--
    And he fashioned the first ploughshare.

  And men, taught wisdom from the past,
    In friendship joined their hands,
  Hung the sword in the hall, the spear on the wall,
    And ploughed the willing lands;
  And sang: ""Hurrah for Tubal Cain!

And there endured her fingers' touch
And from her fingers ate its bit.

Did she in touching that lone wing
Recall the years before her mind
Became a bitter, an abstract thing,
Her thought some popular enmity:
Blind and leader of the blind
Drinking the foul ditch where they lie?

When long ago I saw her ride
Under Ben Bulben to the meet,
The beauty of her country-side
With all youth's lonely wildness stirred,
She seemed to have grown clean and sweet
Like any rock-bred, sea-borne bird:

Sea-borne, or balanced in the air
When first it sprang out of the nest
Upon some lofty rock to stare
Upon the cloudy canopy,
While under its storm-beaten breast
Cried out the hollows of the sea.",On a Political Prisoner,Nature
WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS,"There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend,
And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,
Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming
And humming sands, where windy surges wend:
And he called loudly to the stars to bend
From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they
Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend
Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!
The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,
Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.
He fled the persecution of her glory
And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,
Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening.
But naught they heard, for they are always listening,
The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend
Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,
And thought, I will my heavy story tell
Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send
Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;
And my own tale again for me shall sing,
And my own whispering words be comforting,
And lo! my ancient burden may depart.
Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;
But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone
Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan
Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.",The Sad Shepherd,Nature
WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS,"The woods of Arcady are dead,
And over is their antique joy;
Of old the world on dreaming fed;
Grey Truth is now her painted toy;
Yet still she turns her restless head:
But O, sick children of the world,
Of all the many changing things
In dreary dancing past us whirled,
To the cracked tune that Chronos sings,
Words alone are certain good.
Where are now the warring kings,
Word be-mockers?  By the Rood
Where are now the warring kings?
An idle word is now their glory,
By the stammering schoolboy said,
Reading some entangled story:
The kings of the old time are dead;
The wandering earth herself may be
Only a sudden flaming word,
In clanging space a moment heard,
Troubling the endless reverie.

Then nowise worship dusty deeds,
Nor seek, for this is also sooth,
To hunger fiercely after truth,
Lest all thy toiling only breeds
New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth
Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then,
No learning from the starry men,
Who follow with the optic glass
The whirling ways of stars that pass  
Seek, then, for this is also sooth,
No word of theirs  the cold star-bane
Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain,
And dead is all their human truth.
Go gather by the humming sea
Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell,
And to its lips thy story tell,
And they thy comforters will be,
Rewarding in melodious guile
Thy fretful words a little while,
Till they shall singing fade in ruth
And die a pearly brotherhood;
For words alone are certain good:
Sing, then, for this is also sooth.

I must be gone: there is a grave
Where daffodil and lily wave,
And I would please the hapless faun,
Buried under the sleepy ground,
With mirthful songs before the dawn.
His shouting days with mirth were crowned;
And still I dream he treads the lawn,
Walking ghostly in the dew,
Pierced by my glad singing through,
My songs of old earth's dreamy youth:
But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou!
For fair are poppies on the brow:
Dream, dream, for this is also sooth.",The Song of the Happy Shepherd,Nature

Because a fire was in my head,
And cut and peeled a hazel wand,

And when white moths were on the wing,
And moth-like stars were flickering out,
I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

When I had laid it on the floor
I went to blow the fire a-flame,
But something rustled on the floor,
And someone called me by my name:
It had become a glimmering girl
With apple blossom in her hair
Who called me by my name and ran
And faded through the brightening air.

Though I am old with wandering
Through hollow lands and hilly lands,
I will find out where she has gone,

A thread of water, churned to milky spate
Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.

Through the rich halo that they do not trouble   
Even to cast upon the seasons fleeting
Though they should thin and die on last years stubble.

And they are awkward, ponderous and uncoy . . .   
While we who press the cider mill, regarding them
We, who with pledges taste the bright annoy   
Of friendships acid wine, retarding phlegm,
Shifting reprisals (til who shall tell us when

Who would, ourselves, stalk down the merriest ghost.

Through mapled vistas, cancelled reservations!

From four horizons that no one relates . . .

To the persuasive suburban land agent
In bootleg roadhouses where the gin fizz
Bubbles in time to Hollywoods new love-nest pageant.

A welcome to highsteppers that no mouse
Who saw the Friends there ever heard before.

Who holds the lease on time and on disgrace?   
What eats the pattern with ubiquity?
Where are my kinsmen and the patriarch race?

Dead rangers bled their comfort on the snow;   
But I must ask slain Iroquois to guide
Me farther than scalped Yankees knew to go:

With birthright by blackmail, the arrant page   
That unfolds a new destiny to fill . . . .

Must we descend as worms eye to construe   
Our love of all we touch, and take it to the Gate
As humbly as a guest who knows himself too late,
His news already told? Yes, while the heart is wrung,
Ariseyes, take this sheaf of dust upon your tongue!
In one last angelus lift throbbing throat
Listen, transmuting silence with that stilly note

Of pain that Emily, that Isadora knew!
While high from dim elm-chancels hung with dew,
That triple-noted clause of moonlight
Yes, whip-poor-will, unhusks the heart of fright,
Breaks us and saves, yes, breaks the heart, yet yields

I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,
You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.
And we went on living in the village of Chokan:
Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.
At fourteen I married My Lord you.
I never laughed, being bashful.
Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.
Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.

At fifteen I stopped scowling,
I desired my dust to be mingled with yours
Forever and forever, and forever.
Why should I climb the look out?

At sixteen you departed
You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river of swirling eddies,
And you have been gone five months.
The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.

You dragged your feet when you went out.
By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,
Too deep to clear them away!

The paired butterflies are already yellow with August
Over the grass in the West garden;

Among twenty snowy mountains,   
The only moving thing   
Was the eye of the blackbird.   

II
I was of three minds,   
Like a tree   
In which there are three blackbirds.   

III
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.   
It was a small part of the pantomime.   

IV
A man and a woman   
Are one.   
A man and a woman and a blackbird

I do not know which to prefer,   
The beauty of inflections   
Or the beauty of innuendoes,   
The blackbird whistling   
Or just after.   

VI
Icicles filled the long window   
With barbaric glass.   
The shadow of the blackbird   
Crossed it, to and fro.   
The mood   
Traced in the shadow   
An indecipherable cause.

O thin men of Haddam,   
Why do you imagine golden birds?   
Do you not see how the blackbird   
Walks around the feet   
Of the women about you?

And lucid, inescapable rhythms;   
But I know, too,

Calm was the sea to which your course you kept,
Oh, how much calmer than all southern seas!
Many your nameless mates, whom the keen breeze
Wafted from mothers that of old have wept.
All souls of children taken as they slept
Are your companions, partners of your ease,
And the green souls of all these autumn trees
Are with you through the silent spaces swept.
Your virgin body gave its gentle breath
Untainted to the gods. Why should we grieve,
But that we merit not your holy death?
We shall not loiter long, your friends and I;
Living you made it goodlier to live,
Dead you will make it easier to die.

II

With you a part of me hath passed away;
For in the peopled forest of my mind
A tree made leafless by this wintry wind
Shall never don again its green array.
Chapel and fireside, country road and bay,
Have something of their friendliness resigned;
Another, if I would, I could not find,
And I am grown much older in a day.
But yet I treasure in my memory
Your gift of charity, your mellow ease,
And the dear honour of your amity;
For these once mine, my life is rich with these.
And I scarce know which part may greater be,
What I keep of you, or you rob of me.

III

Your bark lies anchored in the peaceful bight
Until a kinder wind unfurl her sail;
Your docile spirit, winged by this gale,
Hath at the dawning fled into the light.
And I half know why heaven deemed it right
Your youth, and this my joy in youth, should fail;
God hath them still, for ever they avail,
Eternity hath borrowed that delight.
For long ago I taught my thoughts to run
Where all the great things live that lived of yore,
And in eternal quiet float and soar;
There all my loves are gathered into one,
Where change is not, nor parting any more,
Nor revolution of the moon and sun.

IV

In my deep heart these chimes would still have rung
To toll your passing, had you not been dead;
For time a sadder mask than death may spread
Over the face that ever should be young.
The bough that falls with all its trophies hung
Falls not too soon, but lays its flower-crowned head
Most royal in the dust, with no leaf shed
Unhallowed or unchiselled or unsung.
And though the after world will never hear
The happy name of one so gently true,
Nor chronicles write large this fatal year,
Yet we who loved you, though we be but few,
Keep you in whatsoeer is good, and rear
In our weak virtues monuments to you.",To. W. P.,Nature

D. H. LAWRENCE,"Even iron can put forth,
Even iron.

This is the iron age,
But let us take heart
Seeing iron break and bud,
Seeing rusty iron puff with clouds of blossom.

The almond-tree,
December's bare iron hooks sticking out of earth.

The almond-tree,
That knows the deadliest poison, like a snake
In supreme bitterness.

Upon the iron, and upon the steel,
Odd flakes as if of snow, odd bits of snow,
Odd crumbs of melting snow.

But you mistake, it is not from the sky;
From out the iron, and from out the steel,
Flying not down from heaven, but storming up,
Strange storming up from the dense under-earth
Along the iron, to the living steel
In rose-hot tips, and flakes of rose-pale snow
Setting supreme annunciation to the world.

Nay, what a heart of delicate super-faith,
Iron-breaking,
The rusty swords of almond-trees.

Trees suffer, like races, down the long ages.
They wander and are exiled, they live in exile through long ages
Like drawn blades never sheathed, hacked and gone black,
The alien trees in alien lands: and yet
The heart of blossom,
The unquenchable heart of blossom!

Look at the many-cicatrised frail vine, none more scarred and frail,
Yet see him fling himself abroad in fresh abandon
From the small wound-stump.

Even the wilful, obstinate, gummy fig-tree
Can be kept down, but he'll burst like a polyp into prolixity.

And the almond-tree, in exile, in the iron age!

This is the ancient southern earth whence the vases were baked, amphoras, craters, cantharus, oenochoe, and open-hearted cylix,
Bristling now with the iron of almond-trees

Iron, but unforgotten,
Iron, dawn-hearted,
Ever-beating dawn-heart, enveloped in iron against the exile, against the ages.

See it come forth in blossom
From the snow-remembering heart
In long-nighted January,
In the long dark nights of the evening star, and Sirius, and the Etna snow-wind through the long night.

Sweating his drops of blood through the long-nighted Gethsemane
Into blossom, into pride, into honey-triumph, into most exquisite splendour.
Oh, give me the tree of life in blossom
And the Cross sprouting its superb and fearless flowers!

Something must be reassuring to the almond, in the evening star, and the snow-wind, and the long, long, nights,
Some memory of far, sun-gentler lands,
So that the faith in his heart smiles again
And his blood ripples with that untenable delight of once-more-vindicated faith,
And the Gethsemane blood at the iron pores unfolds, unfolds,
Pearls itself into tenderness of bud
And in a great and sacred forthcoming steps forth, steps out in one stride
A naked tree of blossom, like a bridegroom bathing in dew, divested of cover,
Frail-naked, utterly uncovered
To the green night-baying of the dog-star, Etna's snow-edged wind
And January's loud-seeming sun.

Think of it, from the iron fastness
Suddenly to dare to come out naked, in perfection of blossom, beyond the sword-rust.
Think, to stand there in full-unfolded nudity, smiling,
With all the snow-wind, and the sun-glare, and the dog-star baying epithalamion.

Oh, honey-bodied beautiful one,
Come forth from iron,
Red your heart is.
Fragile-tender, fragile-tender life-body,
More fearless than iron all the time,
And so much prouder, so disdainful of reluctances.

In the distance like hoar-frost, like silvery ghosts communing on a green hill,
Hoar-frost-like and mysterious.

In the garden raying out
With a body like spray, dawn-tender, and looking about
With such insuperable, subtly-smiling assurance,
Sword-blade-born.

Unpromised,
No bounds being set.
Flaked out and come unpromised,
The tree being life-divine,
Fearing nothing, life-blissful at the core
Within iron and earth.

Knots of pink, fish-silvery
In heaven, in blue, blue heaven,
Soundless, bliss-full, wide-rayed, honey-bodied,
Red at the core,
Red at the core,
Knotted in heaven upon the fine light.

Open,
Open,
Five times wide open,
Six times wide open,
And given, and perfect;
And red at the core with the last sore-heartedness,
Sore-hearted-looking.",Almond Blossom,Nature

When the sun from the west, beyond Pisa, beyond the mountains of Carrara
Departs, and the world is taken by surprise ...

When the tired flower of Florence is in gloom beneath the glowing
Brown hills surrounding ...

When under the arches of the Ponte Vecchio

Against the current of obscure Arno ...

Look up, and you see things flying
Between the day and the night;
Swallows with spools of dark thread sewing the shadows together.

Where light pushes through;
A sudden turning upon itself of a thing in the air.
A dip to the water.

Swallows?

Dark air-life looping
Yet missing the pure loop ...
A twitch, a twitter, an elastic shudder in flight
And serrated wings against the sky,
Like a glove, a black glove thrown up at the light,
And falling back.

Little lumps that fly in air and have voices indefinite, wildly vindictive;

Wings like bits of umbrella.

And disgustingly upside down.

Hanging upside down like rows of disgusting old rags
And grinning in their sleep.

Lifted, grasping the golden light
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves

In the west I see a redness come
Over the evening's burning breast 
        'Tis the wound of love goes home!

The woodbine creeps abroad
Calling low to her lover:
The sun-lit flirt who all the day
Has poised above her lips in play
And stolen kisses, shallow and gay
Of pollen, now has gone away
 She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,
And when above her his broad wings hover
Then her bright breast she will uncover
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.

Into the yellow, evening glow
Saunters a man from the farm below,
Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.
The bird lies warm against the wall.
She glances quick her startled eyes
Towards him, then she turns away
Her small head, making warm display
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway
Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies
In one blue stoop from out the sties
Into the evening's empty hall.

Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes
Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,
Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.

The rabbit presses back her ears,
Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes
And crouches low: then with wild spring
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming
To be choked back, the wire ring
Her frantic effort throttling:
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!

Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes
And ready to open in brown surprise
Should I not answer to his talk
Or should he my tears surmise.

I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair
Watching the door open: he flashes bare
His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board
And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword
Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud
His coming: he raises up my face to him
And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim
Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!
I know not what fine wire is round my throat,
I only know I let him finger there
My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:
And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood
Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood
Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown

Wild puffing of emerald trees, and flame-filled bushes,
Thorn-blossom lifting in wreaths of smoke between
Where the wood fumes up and the watery, flickering rushes.

I am amazed at this spring, this conflagration
Of green fires lit on the soil of the earth, this blaze
Of growing, and sparks that puff in wild gyration,
Faces of people streaming across my gaze.

And I, what fountain of fire am I among

About like a shadow buffeted in the throng
Of flames, a shadow that's gone astray, and is lost.",The Enkindled Spring,Nature

This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God!

Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.

You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see
Your face grow mystical, as on that night

I linger to watch her;
She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window

Sway like full-blown yellow

PAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR,"Pray why are you so bare, so bare,
   Oh, bough of the old oak-tree;
And why, when I go through the shade you throw,
   Runs a shudder over me?

My leaves were green as the best, I trow,
   And sap ran free in my veins,
But I say in the moonlight dim and weird
   A guiltless victim's pains.

I bent me down to hear his sigh;
   I shook with his gurgling moan,
And I trembled sore when they rode away,
   And left him here alone.

They'd charged him with the old, old crime,
   And set him fast in jail:
Oh, why does the dog howl all night long,
   And why does the night wind wail?

He prayed his prayer and he swore his oath,
   And he raised his hand to the sky;
But the beat of hoofs smote on his ear,
   And the steady tread drew nigh.

Who is it rides by night, by night,
   Over the moonlit road?
And what is the spur that keeps the pace,
   What is the galling goad?

And now they beat at the prison door,
   ""Ho, keeper, do not stay!
We are friends of him whom you hold within,
   And we fain would take him away

""From those who ride fast on our heels
   With mind to do him wrong;
They have no care for his innocence,
   And the rope they bear is long.""

They have fooled the jailer with lying words,
   They have fooled the man with lies;
The bolts unbar, the locks are drawn,
   And the great door open flies.

Now they have taken him from the jail,
   And hard and fast they ride,
And the leader laughs low down in his throat,
   As they halt my trunk beside.

Oh, the judge, he wore a mask of black,
   And the doctor one of white,
And the minister, with his oldest son,
   Was curiously bedight.

Oh, foolish man, why weep you now?
   'Tis but a little space,
And the time will come when these shall dread
   The mem'ry of your face.

I feel the rope against my bark,
   And the weight of him in my grain,
I feel in the throe of his final woe
   The touch of my own last pain.

And never more shall leaves come forth
   On the bough that bears the ban;
I am burned with dread, I am dried and dead,
   From the curse of a guiltless man.

And ever the judge rides by, rides by,
   And goes to hunt the deer,
And ever another rides his soul
   In the guise of a mortal fear.

And ever the man he rides me hard,
   And never a night stays he;

LOUIS UNTERMEYER,"We passed old farmer Boothby in the field.
Rugged and straight he stood; his body steeled
With stubbornness and age. We met his eyes
That never flinched or turned to compromise,
And Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,
Knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm
In all of Maine could boast of; and away
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...
We walked on leisurely until a bend
Showed him once more, now working toward the end
Of one great path; wearing his eighty years
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.

Then we turned off abruptlytook the road
Cutting the village, the one with the commanding
View of the river. And we strode
More briskly now to the long pier that showed
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.
In the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped
Leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped
More on than in the water. Smoothly then
We shot its nose against the rippling current,
Feeling the rising rivers half-deterrent
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade
To keep from swerving round; while we delayed
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks;
Or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....
Blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted
A thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.
And over us the wise and noble-hearted
Twilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,
And we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk
Down the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,

Motionless in the meadows
The trees, the rocks, the cows...
And quiet dripped from the shadows
Like rain from heavy boughs.

The tree-toads started ringing
Their ceaseless silver bells;
A land-locked breeze came swinging
Its censer of earthy smells.

The rivers tiny canon
Stretched into dusky lands;
Like a dark and silent companion
Evening held out her hands.

Hushed were the dawns bravados;
Loud noon was a silenced cry
And quiet slipped from the shadows
As stars slip out of the sky...

It must have been an hour more, or later,
When, tramping homeward through the piney wood,
We felt the years fly back; the brotherhood
Of forests took usand we saw the satyr!
There in a pool, up to his neck, he stood
And grinned to see us stare, incredulous
Too startled to remember fear or flight.
Feeling the menace in the crafty night,
We turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!
Using our very names he called. We drew
With creaking courage down the avenue
Of birches till we saw, with clearing sight,
(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)
Familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,
And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!
The woods became his background; every tree
Seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared
The beauty of that gnarled serenity;
The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared
Its shoulders against Time ... And even night
Flowed in and out of him, as though content
With such a native element;
Happy to move about a spirit quite
As old, as placid and as confident...
Sideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad
He leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,
His body in the moonlight dripping stars...

We went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.",Magic,Nature

The winter evening settles down
With smell of steaks in passageways.
Six oclock.
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.
And now a gusty shower wraps
The grimy scraps
Of withered leaves about your feet
And newspapers from vacant lots;
The showers beat
On broken blinds and chimney-pots,
And at the corner of the street
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.

And then the lighting of the lamps.

II
The morning comes to consciousness
Of faint stale smells of beer
From the sawdust-trampled street
With all its muddy feet that press
To early coffee-stands.
With the other masquerades
That time resumes,
One thinks of all the hands
That are raising dingy shades
In a thousand furnished rooms.

III
You tossed a blanket from the bed,
You lay upon your back, and waited;
You dozed, and watched the night revealing
The thousand sordid images
Of which your soul was constituted;
They flickered against the ceiling.
And when all the world came back
And the light crept up between the shutters
And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,
You had such a vision of the street
As the street hardly understands;
Sitting along the beds edge, where
You curled the papers from your hair,
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
In the palms of both soiled hands.

IV
His soul stretched tight across the skies
That fade behind a city block,
Or trampled by insistent feet
At four and five and six oclock;
And short square fingers stuffing pipes,
And evening newspapers, and eyes
Assured of certain certainties,
The conscience of a blackened street
Impatient to assume the world.

I am moved by fancies that are curled
Around these images, and cling:
The notion of some infinitely gentle
Infinitely suffering thing.

Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;
The worlds revolve like ancient women
Gathering fuel in vacant lots.",Preludes,Nature
HART CRANE,"The willows carried a slow sound,
A sarabande the wind mowed on the mead.
I could never remember
That seething, steady leveling of the marshes
Till age had brought me to the sea.

Flags, weeds. And remembrance of steep alcoves
Where cypresses shared the noons
Tyranny; they drew me into hades almost.
And mammoth turtles climbing sulphur dreams
Yielded, while sun-silt rippled them
Asunder ...

How much I would have bartered! the black gorge
And all the singular nestings in the hills
Where beavers learn stitch and tooth.
The pond I entered once and quickly fled
I remember now its singing willow rim.

And finally, in that memory all things nurse;
After the city that I finally passed
With scalding unguents spread and smoking darts
The monsoon cut across the delta
At gulf gates ... There, beyond the dykes

I heard wind flaking sapphire, like this summer,
And willows could not hold more steady sound.",Repose of Rivers,Nature
T. S. ELIOT,"Twelve o'clock.
Along the reaches of the street
Held in a lunar synthesis,
Whispering lunar incantations
Dissolve the floors of memory
And all its clear relations,
Its divisions and precisions,
Every street lamp that I pass
Beats like a fatalistic drum,
And through the spaces of the dark
Midnight shakes the memory
As a madman shakes a dead geranium.

Half-past one,
The street lamp sputtered,
The street lamp muttered,
The street lamp said, ""Regard that woman
Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door
Which opens on her like a grin.
You see the border of her dress
Is torn and stained with sand,
And you see the corner of her eye
Twists like a crooked pin.""

The memory throws up high and dry
A crowd of twisted things;
A twisted branch upon the beach
Eaten smooth, and polished
As if the world gave up
The secret of its skeleton,
Stiff and white.
A broken spring in a factory yard,
Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
Hard and curled and ready to snap.

Half-past two,
The street lamp said,
""Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
Slips out its tongue
And devours a morsel of rancid butter.""
So the hand of a child, automatic,
Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.
I could see nothing behind that child's eye.
I have seen eyes in the street
Trying to peer through lighted shutters,
And a crab one afternoon in a pool,
An old crab with barnacles on his back,
Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.

Half-past three,
The lamp sputtered,
The lamp muttered in the dark.

The lamp hummed:
""Regard the moon,
La lune ne garde aucune rancune,
She winks a feeble eye,
She smiles into corners.
She smoothes the hair of the grass.
The moon has lost her memory.
A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,
Her hand twists a paper rose,
That smells of dust and old Cologne,
She is alone
With all the old nocturnal smells
That cross and cross across her brain.""
The reminiscence comes
Of sunless dry geraniums
And dust in crevices,
Smells of chestnuts in the streets,
And female smells in shuttered rooms,
And cigarettes in corridors
And cocktail smells in bars.""

The lamp said,
""Four o'clock,
Here is the number on the door.
Memory!
You have the key,
The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,
Mount.
The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,
Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.""

EZRA POUND,"May I for my own self song's truth reckon,
Journey's jargon, how I in harsh days
Hardship endured oft.
Bitter breast-cares have I abided,
Known on my keel many a care's hold,
And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent
Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship's head
While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted,
My feet were by frost benumbed.
Chill its chains are; chafing sighs
Hew my heart round and hunger begot
Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not
That he on dry land loveliest liveth,
List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,
Weathered the winter, wretched outcast
Deprived of my kinsmen;
Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,
There I heard naught save the harsh sea
And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,
Did for my games the gannet's clamour,
Sea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter,
The mews' singing all my mead-drink.
Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern
In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed
With spray on his pinion.
Not any protector
May make merry man faring needy.
This he little believes, who aye in winsome life
Abides 'mid burghers some heavy business,
Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft
Must bide above brine.
Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north,
Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then
Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now
The heart's thought that I on high streams
The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.
Moaneth alway my mind's lust
That I fare forth, that I afar hence
Seek out a foreign fastness.
For this there's no mood-lofty man over earth's midst,
Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed;
Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful
But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare
Whatever his lord will.
He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having
Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight
Nor any whit else save the wave's slash,
Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.
Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,
Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,
All this admonisheth man eager of mood,
The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks
On flood-ways to be far departing.
Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,
He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,
The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not 
He the prosperous man  what some perform
Where wandering them widest draweth.
So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,
My mood 'mid the mere-flood,
Over the whale's acre, would wander wide.
On earth's shelter cometh oft to me,
Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,
Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,
O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow
My lord deems to me this dead life
On loan and on land, I believe not
That any earth-weal eternal standeth
Save there be somewhat calamitous
That, ere a man's tide go, turn it to twain.
Disease or oldness or sword-hate
Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body.
And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after 
Laud of the living, boasteth some last word,
That he will work ere he pass onward,
Frame on the fair earth 'gainst foes his malice,
Daring ado, ...
So that all men shall honour him after
And his laud beyond them remain 'mid the English,
Aye, for ever, a lasting life's-blast,
Delight mid the doughty.
Days little durable,
And all arrogance of earthen riches,
There come now no kings nor Csars
Nor gold-giving lords like those gone.
Howe'er in mirth most magnified,
Whoe'er lived in life most lordliest,
Drear all this excellence, delights undurable!
Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth.
Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.
Earthly glory ageth and seareth.
No man at all going the earth's gait,
But age fares against him, his face paleth,
Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,
Lordly men are to earth o'ergiven,

The brilliant moon and all the milky sky,   
And all that famous harmony of leaves,   
Had blotted out man's image and his cry.

A girl arose that had red mournful lips
And seemed the greatness of the world in tears,   
Doomed like Odysseus and the labouring ships   
And proud as Priam murdered with his peers;

And all the lonelier stars that have their place,
Calm lamps within the distant southern sky,
And planet-dust upon the edge of space,

Look up to outer vastness unafraid
And see the stars which sang when earth was made.",Stars,Nature

And over them the beet-fields grow,
A fortress gentle as a grave.

Morose, impatient, sick at heart,
With rasping nerves and twitching muscles,
We cannot even sleep; we start
With every twig that snaps or rustles.
Sought always by an unseen foe
Over our heads the bullets fly;
But more than these, we fear the snow,
The silent shrapnel of the sky.

Yonder our colonel stalks and grieves,
Meeting the storm with thoughts more stormy;
But we, we sit and watch the leaves
Fall down, a torn and crumpled army.
We mourn for every leaf that lies,
As though it were a comrade slain;
Each was a shelter from the eyes
Of every prying aeroplane. . . 

And in its cloudy uniform,
Stilling the cannons earthly thunder,
The huge artillery of the storm
Plows through the land and pulls it under.

D. H. LAWRENCE,"[Version 1: 1921]
The quick sparks on the gorse bushes are leaping,
Little jets of sunlight-texture imitating flame;
Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:
They are lords of the desolate wastes of sadness their screamings proclaim.

Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie
Low-rounded on the mournful grass they have bitten down to the quick.
Are they asleep?  Are they alive?  Now see, when I
Move my arms the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick.

The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;
There the lazy streamlet pushes
Its curious course mildly; here it wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes.

Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,
Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow,
Naked on the steep, soft lip
Of the bank I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.

What if the gorse flowers shrivelled and kissing were lost?
Without the pulsing waters, where were the marigolds and the songs of the brook!
If my veins and my breasts with love embossed
Withered, my insolent soul would be gone like flowers that the hot wind took.

So my soul like a passionate woman turns,
Filled with remorseful terror to the man she scorned, and her love
For myself in my own eyes' laughter burns,
Runs ecstatic over the pliant folds rippling down to my belly from the breast-lights above.

Over my sunlit skin the warm, clinging air,
Rich with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.
And the soul of the wind and my blood compare
Their wandering happiness, and the wind, wasted in liberty, drifts on and is sad.

Oh but the water loves me and folds me,
Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me as though it were living blood,
Blood of a heaving woman who holds me,
Owning my supple body a rare glad thing, supremely good.

The quick sparks on the gorse-bushes are leaping
Little jets of sunlight texture imitating flame;
Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:
They have triumphed again o'er the ages, their screamings proclaim.

Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie
Low-rounded on the mournful turf they have bitten down to the quick.
Are they asleep?  are they living?  Now see, when I
Lift my arms, the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick!

The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;
There the lazy streamlet pushes
His bent course mildly; here wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes

Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,
Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow;
Naked on the steep, soft lip
Of the turf I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.

What if the gorse-flowers shrivelled, and I were gone?
What if the waters ceased, where were the marigolds then, and the gudgeon?
What is this thing that I look down upon?
White on the water wimples my shadow, strains like a dog on a string, to run on.

How it looks back, like a white dog to its master!
I on the bank all substance, my shadow all shadow looking up to me, looking back!
And the water runs, and runs faster, runs faster,
And the white dog dances and quivers, I am holding his cord quite slack.

But how splendid it is to be substance, here!
My shadow is neither here nor there; but I, I am royally here!
I am here! I am here! screams the peewit; the may-blobs burst out in a laugh as they hear!
Here! flick the rabbits. Here! pants the gorse. Here! say the insects far and near.

Over my skin in the sunshine, the warm, clinging air
Flushed with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.
You are here! You are here! We have found you! Everywhere
We sought you substantial, you touchstone of caresses, you naked lad!

Oh but the water loves me and folds me,
Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me, murmurs: Oh marvellous stuff!
No longer shadow!  and it holds me
Close, and it rolls me, enfolds me, touches me, as if never it could touch me enough.

Sun, but in substance, yellow water-blobs!
Wings and feathers on the crying, mysterious ages, peewits wheeling!
All that is right, all that is good; all that is God takes substance! a rabbit lobs

The woodland paths are dry,
Under the October twilight the water
Mirrors a still sky;
Upon the brimming water among the stones
Are nine-and-fifty swans.

The nineteenth autumn has come upon me
Since I first made my count;
I saw, before I had well finished,
All suddenly mount
And scatter wheeling in great broken rings
Upon their clamorous wings.

I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,
And now my heart is sore.
All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,
The first time on this shore,
The bell-beat of their wings above my head,
Trod with a lighter tread.

Unwearied still, lover by lover,
They paddle in the cold
Companionable streams or climb the air;
Their hearts have not grown old;
Passion or conquest, wander where they will,
Attend upon them still.

But now they drift on the still water,
Mysterious, beautiful;

O you gods that sit and give
The world its orders.
Give me hunger, pain and want,
Shut me out with shame and failure
From your doors of gold and fame,

But leave me a little love,
A voice to speak to me in the day end,
A hand to touch me in the dark room
Breaking the long loneliness.
In the dusk of day-shapes
Blurring the sunset,
One little wandering, western star
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow.

Watch there the day-shapes of dusk
And wait and know the coming
Of a little love.",At a Window,Nature

By doorways where women haggard
Looked from their hunger-deep eyes,
Haunted with shadows of hunger-hands,
Out from the huddled and ugly walls,
I came sudden, at the city's edge,
On a blue burst of lake,
Long lake waves breaking under the sun
On a spray-flung curve of shore;
And a fluttering storm of gulls,
Masses of great gray wings
And flying white bellies
Veering and wheeling free in the open.",The Harbor,Nature

Yes, Momus,
Men have flung your face in bronze
To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.
They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,
Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;
All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones
Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by God.

I wonder, Momus,
Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter
On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history.
A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze,
You give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple, silent;
Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves,
Careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and women
Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil, the salt of tears,
And blood drops of undiminishing war.",Momus,Nature

Where tall trees flank the way
And shoulder toward the sky.

Thou art an healing wind

A-tremble with dew;
Thou art a wind flowing
Over long leagues of lonely sea;
Thou art the dusk and the fragrance;
Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;
Thou art the pale peace of one
Satiate with old desires;
Thou art the silence of beauty,
And we look no more for the morning;
We yearn no more for the sun,
Since with thy white hands,
Death,
Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,
The slim colorless poppies
Which in thy garden alone
Softly thou gatherest.

And silently;
And with slow feet approaching;
And with bowed head and unlit eyes,
We kneel before thee:
And thou, leaning towards us, Caressingly layest upon us
Flowers from thy thin cold hands,
And, smiling as a chaste woman Knowing love in her heart,
Thou sealest our eyes
And the illimitable quietude
Comes gently upon us.",,Nature

ELINOR WYLIE,"                                  1 

When the world turns completely upside down
You say well emigrate to the Eastern Shore
Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore;
Well live among wild peach trees, miles from town,
Youll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown
Homespun, dyed butternuts dark gold color.
Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor,
Well swim in milk and honey till we drown.

The winter will be short, the summer long,
The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot,
Tasting of cider and of scuppernong;
All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all.
The squirrels in their silver fur will fall
Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot.


                                  2 

The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass
Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold.
The misted early mornings will be cold;
The little puddles will be roofed with glass.
The sun, which burns from copper into brass,
Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold
Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold
Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.

Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover;
A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year;
The spring begins before the winters over.
By February you may find the skins
Of garter snakes and water moccasins
Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear.


                                  3 

When April pours the colors of a shell
Upon the hills, when every little creek
Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake
In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell,
When strawberries go begging, and the sleek
Blue plums lie open to the blackbirds beak,
We shall live well  we shall live very well.

The months between the cherries and the peaches
Are brimming cornucopias which spill
Fruits red and purple, sombre-bloomed and black;
Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches
Well trample bright persimmons, while you kill
Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvasback.


                                  4 

Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones
Theres something in this richness that I hate.
I love the look, austere, immaculate,
Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones.
Theres something in my very blood that owns
Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate,
A thread of water, churned to milky spate
Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.

I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray,
Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meagre sheaves;
That spring, briefer than apple-blossoms breath,
Summer, so much too beautiful to stay,
Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves,
And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death.",Wild Peaches,Love

WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS,"We sat together at one summers end,
That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,   
And you and I, and talked of poetry.
I said, A line will take us hours maybe;
Yet if it does not seem a moments thought,   
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.   
Better go down upon your marrow-bones   
And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones   
Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;   
For to articulate sweet sounds together
Is to work harder than all these, and yet   
Be thought an idler by the noisy set
Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen   
The martyrs call the world.
                                          And thereupon
That beautiful mild woman for whose sake   
Theres many a one shall find out all heartache   
On finding that her voice is sweet and low   
Replied, To be born woman is to know
Although they do not talk of it at school
That we must labour to be beautiful.
I said, Its certain there is no fine thing   
Since Adams fall but needs much labouring.
There have been lovers who thought love should be   
So much compounded of high courtesy   
That they would sigh and quote with learned looks   
Precedents out of beautiful old books;   
Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.

We sat grown quiet at the name of love;   
We saw the last embers of daylight die,   
And in the trembling blue-green of the sky   
A moon, worn as if it had been a shell   
Washed by times waters as they rose and fell   
About the stars and broke in days and years.

I had a thought for no ones but your ears:   
That you were beautiful, and that I strove   
To love you in the old high way of love;
That it had all seemed happy, and yet wed grown   
As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.",Adam's Curse,Love
HART CRANE,"I wanted you, nameless Woman of the South,

vaporous scars!

Unwedded, stumbling gardenless to grieve
Windswept guitars on lonely decks forever;
Finally to answer all within one grave!

And this long wake of phosphor,
iridescent
Furrow of all our traveltrailed derision!
Eyes crumble at its kiss. Its long-drawn spell
Incites a yell. Slid on that backward vision
The mind is churned to spittle, whispering hell.

I wanted you . . . The embers of the Cross
Climbed by aslant and huddling aromatically.
It is blood to remember; it is fire
To stammer back . . . It is
Godyour namelessness. And the wash

All night the water combed you with black
Insolence. You crept out simmering, accomplished.
Water rattled that stinging coil, your
Rehearsed hairdocile, alas, from many arms.

EZRA POUND,"While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,
You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.
And we went on living in the village of Chokan:
Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.
At fourteen I married My Lord you.
I never laughed, being bashful.
Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.
Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.

At fifteen I stopped scowling,
I desired my dust to be mingled with yours
Forever and forever, and forever.
Why should I climb the look out?

At sixteen you departed
You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river of swirling eddies,
And you have been gone five months.
The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.

You dragged your feet when you went out.
By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,
Too deep to clear them away!
The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.
The paired butterflies are already yellow with August
Over the grass in the West garden;
They hurt me.
I grow older.

Please let me know beforehand,
And I will come out to meet you
As far as Cho-fu-Sa.",The River-Merchants Wife: A Letter,Love

In the clear silence Beauty found them
And shewed them all her ways.

In the high noon of the heavenly garden
Where the angels sunned with the birds,
Beauty, before their hearts could harden,
Had taught them heavenly words.

When they fled in the burning weather
And nothing dawned but a dream,
Beauty fasted their hands together

Her cheeks are very smooth, her eyes are closed.

Nay, but she sleeps like a bride, and dreams her dreams

WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS,"The jester walked in the garden:
The garden had fallen still;
He bade his soul rise upward
And stand on her window-sill.

It rose in a straight blue garment,
When owls began to call:
It had grown wise-tongued by thinking
Of a quiet and light footfall;

But the young queen would not listen;
She rose in her pale night-gown;
She drew in the heavy casement
And pushed the latches down.

He bade his heart go to her,
When the owls called out no more;
In a red and quivering garment
It sang to her through the door.

It had grown sweet-tongued by dreaming
Of a flutter of flower-like hair;
But she took up her fan from the table
And waved it off on the air.

'I have cap and bells, he pondered,
'I will send them to her and die;
And when the morning whitened
He left them where she went by.

She laid them upon her bosom,
Under a cloud of her hair,
And her red lips sang them a love-song
Till stars grew out of the air.

She opened her door and her window,
And the heart and the soul came through,
To her right hand came the red one,
To her left hand came the blue.

They set up a noise like crickets,
A chattering wise and sweet,
And her hair was a folded flower
And the quiet of love in her feet.",The Cap and Bells,Love

Lifted, grasping the golden light
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves

Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,
In the west I see a redness come
Over the evening's burning breast 
        'Tis the wound of love goes home!

The woodbine creeps abroad
Calling low to her lover:
The sun-lit flirt who all the day
Has poised above her lips in play
And stolen kisses, shallow and gay
Of pollen, now has gone away
 She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,
And when above her his broad wings hover
Then her bright breast she will uncover
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.

Into the yellow, evening glow
Saunters a man from the farm below,
Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.
The bird lies warm against the wall.
She glances quick her startled eyes
Towards him, then she turns away
Her small head, making warm display
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway
Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies
In one blue stoop from out the sties
Into the evening's empty hall.

Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes
Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,
Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.

The rabbit presses back her ears,
Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes
And crouches low: then with wild spring
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming
To be choked back, the wire ring
Her frantic effort throttling:
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!

Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes
And ready to open in brown surprise
Should I not answer to his talk
Or should he my tears surmise.

I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair
Watching the door open: he flashes bare
His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board
And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword
Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud
His coming: he raises up my face to him
And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim
Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!
I know not what fine wire is round my throat,
I only know I let him finger there
My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:
And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood
Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood
Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown
Within him, die, and find death good.",Cruelty and Love ,Love

Blossom you stalk by stalk,

Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming question ...
Oh, do not ask, What is it?
Let us go and make our visit.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
And seeing that it was a soft October night,
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

And indeed there will be time
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
There will be time, there will be time
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
There will be time to murder and create,
And time for all the works and days of hands
That lift and drop a question on your plate;
Time for you and time for me,
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
Before the taking of a toast and tea.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

And indeed there will be time
To wonder, Do I dare? and, Do I dare?
Time to turn back and descend the stair,
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair 
(They will say: How his hair is growing thin!)
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin 
(They will say: But how his arms and legs are thin!)
Do I dare
Disturb the universe?
In a minute there is time
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.

For I have known them all already, known them all:
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
I know the voices dying with a dying fall
Beneath the music from a farther room.
               So how should I presume?

And I have known the eyes already, known them all
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
               And how should I presume?

And I have known the arms already, known them all
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)
Is it perfume from a dress
That makes me so digress?
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
               And should I then presume?
               And how should I begin?

Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...

I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!
Smoothed by long fingers,
Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet  and heres no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.

And would it have been worth it, after all,
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
Would it have been worth while,
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
To have squeezed the universe into a ball
To roll it towards some overwhelming question,
To say: I am Lazarus, come from the dead,
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all
If one, settling a pillow by her head
               Should say: That is not what I meant at all;
               That is not it, at all.

And would it have been worth it, after all,
Would it have been worth while,
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor
And this, and so much more?
It is impossible to say just what I mean!
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
Would it have been worth while
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
And turning toward the window, should say:
               That is not it at all,
               That is not what I meant, at all.

No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
Am an attendant lord, one that will do
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,
Deferential, glad to be of use,
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous
Almost, at times, the Fool.

I grow old ... I grow old ...
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.

Shall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.

I do not think that they will sing to me.

I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
When the wind blows the water white and black.

By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.",The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,Love

And played snap-out at Winchester.
One time we changed partners,
Driving home in the moonlight of middle June,
And then I found Davis.
We were married and lived together for seventy years,
Enjoying, working, raising the twelve children,
Eight of whom we lost
Ere I had reached the age of sixty.
I spun, I wove, I kept the house, I nursed the sick,
I made the garden, and for holiday
Rambled over the fields where sang the larks,

And many a flower and medicinal weed 
Shouting to the wooded hills, singing to the green valleys.
At ninety-six I had lived enough, that is all,

The woman I might grow to be;
I felt my lover look at her
And then turn suddenly to me.

Her hair was dull and drew no light
And yet its color was as mine;
Her eyes were strangely like my eyes
Tho' love had never made them shine.

Her body was a thing grown thin,
Hungry for love that never came;
Her soul was frozen in the dark
Unwarmed forever by love's flame.

Just as my fingers on these keys
Make music, so the selfsame sounds
On my spirit make a music, too.

Music is feeling, then, not sound;
And thus it is that what I feel,
Here in this room, desiring you,

Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk,
Is music. It is like the strain
Waked in the elders by Susanna: 

Of a green evening, clear and warm,
She bathed in her still garden, while
The red-eyed elders, watching, felt

The basses of their beings throb
In witching chords, and their thin blood
Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna.


                                              II
In the green water, clear and warm,
Susanna lay.
She searched
The touch of springs,
And found
Concealed imaginings.
She sighed,
For so much melody.

Upon the bank, she stood
In the cool
Of spent emotions.
She felt, among the leaves,
The dew
Of old devotions.

She walked upon the grass,
Still quavering.
The winds were like her maids,
On timid feet,
Fetching her woven scarves,
Yet wavering.

A breath upon her hand
Muted the night.
She turned
A cymbal crashed,
And roaring horns.


                                           III
Soon, with a noise like tambourines,
Came her attendant Byzantines.

They wondered why Susanna cried
Against the elders by her side;

And as they whispered, the refrain
Was like a willow swept by rain.

Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame
Revealed Susanna and her shame.

And then, the simpering Byzantines
Fled, with a noise like tambourines.

Beauty is momentary in the mind
The fitful tracing of a portal;
But in the flesh it is immortal.

The body dies; the body's beauty lives.
So evenings die, in their green going,
A wave, interminably flowing.
So gardens die, their meek breath scenting
The cowl of winter, done repenting.
So maidens die, to the auroral
Celebration of a maiden's choral.

Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings
Of those white elders; but, escaping,
Left only Death's ironic scraping.
Now, in its immortality, it plays
On the clear viol of her memory,
And makes a constant sacrament of praise.",Peter Quince at the Clavier,Love
T. S. ELIOT,"I
Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
You have the scene arrange itself  as it will seem to do
With ""I have saved this afternoon for you"";
And four wax candles in the darkened room,
Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
""So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
Should be resurrected only among friends
Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.""
And so the conversation slips
Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
Through attenuated tones of violins
Mingled with remote cornets
And begins.

""You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,
And how, how rare and strange it is, to find
In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,
(For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind!
How keen you are!)
To find a friend who has these qualities,
Who has, and gives
Those qualities upon which friendship lives.
How much it means that I say this to you 
Without these friendships  life, what cauchemar!""
Among the winding of the violins
And the ariettes
Of cracked cornets
Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins
Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,
Capricious monotone
That is at least one definite ""false note.""
 Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,
Admire the monuments,
Discuss the late events,
Correct our watches by the public clocks.
Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.

II
Now that lilacs are in bloom
She has a bowl of lilacs in her room
And twists one in her fingers while she talks.
""Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know
What life is, you who hold it in your hands"";
(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks)
""You let it flow from you, you let it flow,
And youth is cruel, and has no remorse
And smiles at situations which it cannot see.""
I smile, of course,
And go on drinking tea.
""Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall
My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,
I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world
To be wonderful and youthful, after all.""

The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune
Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:
""I am always sure that you understand
My feelings, always sure that you feel,
Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.

You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel.
You will go on, and when you have prevailed
You can say: at this point many a one has failed.

But what have I, but what have I, my friend,
To give you, what can you receive from me?
Only the friendship and the sympathy
Of one about to reach her journey's end.

I shall sit here, serving tea to friends ....""

I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends
For what she has said to me?
You will see me any morning in the park
Reading the comics and the sporting page.
Particularly I remark.
An English countess goes upon the stage.
A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,
Another bank defaulter has confessed.
I keep my countenance,
I remain self-possessed
Except when a street-piano, mechanical and tired
Reiterates some worn-out common song
With the smell of hyacinths across the garden
Recalling things that other people have desired.
Are these ideas right or wrong?

III
The October night comes down; returning as before
Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease
I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door
And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.
""And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?
But that's a useless question.
You hardly know when you are coming back,
You will find so much to learn.""
My smile falls heavily among the bric-a-brac.

""Perhaps you can write to me.""
My self-possession flares up for a second;
This is as I had reckoned.
""I have been wondering frequently of late
(But our beginnings never know our ends!)
Why we have not developed into friends.""
I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark
Suddenly, his expression in a glass.
My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.

""For everybody said so, all our friends,
They all were sure our feelings would relate
So closely! I myself can hardly understand.
We must leave it now to fate.
You will write, at any rate.
Perhaps it is not too late.
I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.""
And I must borrow every changing shape
To find expression ... dance, dance
Like a dancing bear,
Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.
Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance
Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,
Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;
Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand
With the smoke coming down above the housetops;
Doubtful, for quite a while
Not knowing what to feel or if I understand
Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ...
Would she not have the advantage, after all?

Of waters in a land of change.
He goes to see what suns can make
From soil more indurate and strange.

He cuts what holds his days together
And shuts him in, as lock on lock:
The arrowed vane announcing weather,
The tripping racket of a clock;

Seeking, I think, a light that waits
Still as a lamp upon a shelf, 
A land with hills like rocky gates
Where no sea leaps upon itself.

He does not look at her, nor sniff at her,
No, not even sniff at her, his nose is blank.

Only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin
That work beneath her while she sprawls along
In her ungainly pace,
Her folds of skin that work and row
Beneath the earth-soiled hovel in which she moves.

And so he strains beneath her housey walls
And catches her trouser-legs in his beak
Suddenly, or her skinny limb,
And strange and grimly drags at her
Like a dog,
Only agelessly silent, with a reptile's awful persistency.

Grim, gruesome gallantry, to which he is doomed.
Dragged out of an eternity of silent isolation
And doomed to partiality, partial being,
Ache, and want of being,
Want,
Self-exposure, hard humiliation, need to add himself on to her.

Born to walk alone,
Forerunner,
Now suddenly distracted into this mazy side-track,
This awkward, harrowing pursuit,
This grim necessity from within.

As she moves eternally slowly away?
Or is he driven against her with a bang, like a bird flying in the dark against a window,
All knowledgeless?

The awful concussion,
And the still more awful need to persist, to follow, follow, continue,
Driven, after ons of pristine, fore-god-like singleness and oneness,
At the end of some mysterious, red-hot iron,
Driven away from himself into her tracks,
Forced to crash against her.

I said he was dumb,
Yet I've heard him cry.

First faint scream,
Out of life's unfathomable dawn,
Far off, so far, like a madness, under the horizon's dawning rim,
Far, far off, far scream.

Tortoise in extremis.

Why were we crucified into sex?
Why were we not left rounded off, and finished in ourselves,
As we began,
As he certainly began, so perfectly alone?

A far, was-it-audible scream,
Or did it sound on the plasm direct?

Worse than the cry of the new-born,
A scream,
A yell,
A shout,
A pan,
A death-agony,
A birth-cry,
A submission,
All tiny, tiny, far away, reptile under the first dawn.

War-cry, triumph, acute-delight, death-scream reptilian,
Why was the veil torn?
The silken shriek of the soul's torn membrane?
The male soul's membrane
Torn with a shriek half music, half horror.

Crucifixion.
Male tortoise, cleaving behind the hovel-wall of that dense female,
Mounted and tense, spread-eagle, out-reaching out of the shell
In tortoise-nakedness,
Long neck, and long vulnerable limbs extruded, spread-eagle over her house-roof,
And the deep, secret, all-penetrating tail curved beneath her walls,
Reaching and gripping tense, more reaching anguish in uttermost tension
Till suddenly, in the spasm of coition, tupping like a jerking leap, and oh!
Opening its clenched face from his outstretched neck
And giving that fragile yell, that scream,
Super-audible,
From his pink, cleft, old-man's mouth,
Giving up the ghost,
Or screaming in Pentecost, receiving the ghost.

His scream, and his moment's subsidence,
The moment of eternal silence,
Yet unreleased, and after the moment, the sudden, startling jerk of coition, and at once
The inexpressible faint yell 
And so on, till the last plasm of my body was melted back
To the primeval rudiments of life, and the secret.

So he tups, and screams
Time after time that frail, torn scream
After each jerk, the longish interval,
The tortoise eternity,
Agelong, reptilian persistence,
Heart-throb, slow heart-throb, persistent for the next spasm.

I remember, when I was a boy,
I heard the scream of a frog, which was caught with his foot in the mouth of an up-starting snake;
I remember when I first heard bull-frogs break into sound in the spring;
I remember hearing a wild goose out of the throat of night
Cry loudly, beyond the lake of waters;
I remember the first time, out of a bush in the darkness, a nightingale's piercing cries and gurgles startled the depths of my soul;
I remember the scream of a rabbit as I went through a wood at midnight;
I remember the heifer in her heat, blorting and blorting through the hours, persistent and irrepressible;
I remember my first terror hearing the howl of weird, amorous cats;
I remember the scream of a terrified, injured horse, the sheet-lightning
And running away from the sound of a woman in labor, something like an owl whooing,
And listening inwardly to the first bleat of a lamb,
The first wail of an infant,
And my mother singing to herself,
And the first tenor singing of the passionate throat of a young collier, who has long since drunk himself to death,
The first elements of foreign speech
On wild dark lips.

And more than all these,
And less than all these,
This last,
Strange, faint coition yell
Of the male tortoise at extremity,
Tiny from under the very edge of the farthest far-off horizon of life.

The cross,
The wheel on which our silence first is broken,
Sex, which breaks up our integrity, our single inviolability, our deep silence
Tearing a cry from us.

Sex, which breaks us into voice, sets us calling across the deeps, calling, calling for the complement,
Singing, and calling, and singing again, being answered, having found.

Torn, to become whole again, after long seeking for what is lost,
The same cry from the tortoise as from Christ, the Osiris-cry of abandonment,
That which is whole, torn asunder,
That which is in part, finding its whole again throughout the universe.",Tortoise Shout,Love

These garments and decorum;
I am thy brother,
Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,
And thou hearest me not.

I have whispered thee in thy solitudes
Of our loves in Phrygia,
The far ecstasy of burning noons
When the fragile pipes
Ceased in the cypress shade,
And the brown fingers of the shepherd
Moved over slim shoulders;
And only the cicada sang.

I have told thee of the hills
And the lisp of reeds
And the sun upon thy breasts,

And thou hearest me not,

  With all the blue ethereal sky,
  And spangled heavens, a shining frame,
  Their great Original proclaim;
  The unwearied sun, from day to day,
  Does his Creator's power display,
  And publishes to every land
  The work of an Almighty hand.

  Soon as the evening shades prevail,
  The moon takes up the wondrous tale,
  And nightly to the listening earth
  Repeats the story of her birth;
  While all the stars that round her burn,

  Confirm the tidings as they roll,
  And spread the truth from pole to pole.

  Move round the dark terrestrial ball?
  What though no real voice or sound

  That creatures in so high a place

SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"Hast thou a charm to stay the morning star
  In his steep course? So long he seems to pause
  On thy bald, awful head, O sovran Blanc!
  The Arve and Arveiron at thy base
  Rave ceaselessly; but thou, most awful Form,
  Risest from forth thy silent sea of pines
  How silently! Around thee and above,
  Deep is the air and dark, substantial, black--
  An ebon mass. Methinks thou piercest it,
  As with a wedge! But when I look again,
  It is thine own calm home, thy crystal shrine,
  Thy habitation from eternity!
  O dread and silent Mount! I gazed upon thee,
  Till thou, still present to the bodily sense,
  Didst vanish from my thought. Entranced in prayer
  I worshipped the Invisible alone.

    Yet, like some sweet beguiling melody,
  So sweet we know not we are listening to it,
  Thou, the mean while, wast blending with my thought,--
  Yea, with my life and life's own secret joy,--
  Till the dilating soul, enrapt, transfused,
  Into the mighty vision passing, there,
  As in her natural form, swelled vast to Heaven!

    Awake, my soul! not only passive praise
  Thou owest! not alone these swelling tears,
  Mute thanks, and secret ecstasy! Awake,
  Voice of sweet song! Awake, my heart, awake!
  Green vales and icy cliffs, all join my hymn.

    Thou first and chief, sole sovereign of the vale!
  O, struggling with the darkness all the night,
  And visited all night by troops of stars,
  Or when they climb the sky, or when they sink,
  Companion of the morning-star at dawn,
  Thyself Earth's rosy star, and of the dawn
  Co-herald,--wake, O, wake, and utter praise!
  Who sank thy sunless pillars deep in earth?
  Who filled thy countenance with rosy light?
  Who made thee parent of perpetual streams?

    And you, ye five wild torrents fiercely glad!
  Who called you forth from night and utter death,
  From dark and icy caverns called you forth,
  Down those precipitous, black, jagged rocks,
  Forever shattered and the same forever?
  Who gave you your invulnerable life,
  Your strength, your speed, your fury, and your joy,
  Unceasing thunder and eternal foam?
  And who commanded (and the silence came),
  Here let the billows stiffen, and have rest?

    Ye ice-falls! ye that from the mountain's brow
  Adown enormous ravines slope amain,--
  Torrents, methinks, that heard a mighty voice,
  And stopped at once amid their maddest plunge!
  Motionless torrents! silent cataracts!
  Who made you glorious as the gates of Heaven
  Beneath the keen full moon? Who bade the sun
  Clothe you with rainbows? Who, with living flowers
  Of loveliest blue, spread garlands at your feet?
  God!--let the torrents, like a shout of nations,
  Answer! and let the ice-plains echo, God!
  God! sing, ye meadow-streams, with gladsome voice!
  Ye pine-groves, with your soft and soul-like sounds!
  And they too have a voice, yon piles of snow,
  And in their perilous fall shall thunder, God!

  Ye wild goats sporting round the eagle's nest!
  Ye eagles, playmates of the mountain-storm!
  Ye lightnings, the dread arrows of the clouds!
  Ye signs and wonders of the elements!

    Age-hidden in their breast;
  ""God's peace is everlasting,""
    Are the dream-words of their rest.

  He hath made them the haunt of beauty,
    The home elect of his grace;
  He spreadeth his mornings on them,
    His sunsets light their face.

  His thunders tread in music
    Of footfalls echoing long,
  And carry majestic greeting
    Around the silent throng.

  His winds bring messages to them,
    Wild storm-news from the main;
  They sing it down to the valleys
    In the love-song of the rain.

  Green tribes from far come trooping,
    And over the uplands flock;

    In robes for his risen rock.

  They are nurseries for young rivers;
    Nests for his flying cloud;
  Homesteads for new-born races,

    Come up to their shrines and pray;

  The tempest raged in giant wrath,

  I sought a lonely, woody dell,

    Mid bright sunshine did meet:
  I stood beneath an old oak's shade,
    And summer round was fair;
  I gazed upon the peaceful scene,
    And God was there!

  I saw a home--a happy home--
    Upon a bridal day,
  And youthful hearts were blithesome there,
    And aged hearts were gay:
  I sat amid the smiling band
    Where all so blissful were--
  Among the bridal maidens sweet--

  I stood beside an infant's couch,

    For God was there!

  I sought a cheerless wilderness--
    A desert, pathless wild--
  Where verdure grew not by the streams,
    Where beauty never smiled;
  Where desolation brooded o'er
    A muirland lone and bare,
  And awe upon my spirit crept,

    And on each blade of grass;
  Upon the forests, wide and deep,

FRANCIS QUARLES,"I love, and have some cause to love, the earth,--
    She is my Maker's creature, therefore good;

    She is my tender nurse, she gives me food:
    But what's a creature, Lord, compared with thee?
    Or what's my mother or my nurse to me?

  I love the air,--her dainty sweets refresh
    My drooping soul, and to new sweets invite me;
  Her shrill-mouthed choir sustain me with their flesh,
    And with their polyphonian notes delight me:
    But what's the air, or all the sweets that she
    Can bless my soul withal, compared to thee?

  I love the sea,--she is my fellow-creature,
    My careful purveyor; she provides me store;
  She walls me round; she makes my diet greater;
    She wafts my treasure from a foreign shore:
    But, Lord of oceans, when compared with thee,
    What is the ocean or her wealth to me?

  To heaven's high city I direct my journey,
    Whose spangled suburbs entertain mine eye;

    But what is heaven, great God, compared to thee?
    Without thy presence, heaven's no heaven to me.

  Without thy presence, earth gives no refection;
    Without thy presence, sea affords no treasure;
  Without thy presence, air's a rank infection;
    Without thy presence, heaven's itself no pleasure:
    If not possessed, if not enjoyed in thee,
    What's earth, or sea, or air, or heaven to me?

  The highest honors that the world can boast
    Are subjects far too low for my desire;
  The brightest beams of glory are, at most,
    But dying sparkles of thy living fire;
    The loudest flames that earth can kindle be
    But nightly glow-worms, if compared to thee.

  Without thy presence, wealth is bags of cares;
    Wisdom but folly; joy, disquiet--sadness;
  Friendship is treason, and delights are snares;
    Pleasures but pain, and mirth but pleasing madness;
    Without thee, Lord, things be not what they be,
    Nor have their being, when compared with thee.

  In having all things, and not thee, what have I?
    Not having thee, what have my labors got?

    Seven hundred years and fifty-three

    And now was queen of land and sea.
  No sound was heard of clashing wars;
    Peace brooded o'er the hushed domain:
  Apollo, Pallas, Jove, and Mars

    His breast with thoughts of boundless sway;
  What recked the Roman what befell
    A paltry province far away,
        In the solemn midnight,
          Centuries ago?

  Within that province far away
    Went plodding home a weary boor;
  A streak of light before him lay,
    Fallen through a half-shut stable-door
  Across his path. He passed--for naught
    Told what was going on within;
  How keen the stars, his only thought;
    The air how calm and cold and thin,
        In the solemn midnight,
          Centuries ago!

  Could once, at Cana's wedding feast,
    Change water into wine;

  Come, visit us! and when dull work
    Grows weary, line on line,
  Revive our souls, and let us see
    Life's water turned to wine.

  Gay mirth shall deepen into joy,
    Earth's hopes grow half divine,
  When Jesus visits us, to make

  The social talk, the evening fire,
    The homely household shrine,
  Grow bright with angel visits, when

  For when self-seeking turns to love,

ELIZABETH CECILIA CLEPHANE,"There were ninety and nine that safely lay
    In the shelter of the fold;
  But one was out on the hills away,
    Far off from the gates of gold,
  Away on the mountain wild and bare,
  Away from the tender Shepherd's care.

  ""Lord, thou hast here thy ninety and nine:
    Are they not enough for thee?""
  But the Shepherd made answer: ""'T is of mine
    Has wandered away from me;
  And although the road be rough and steep
  I go to the desert to find my sheep.""

  But none of the ransomed ever knew
    How deep were the waters crossed,
  Nor how dark was the night that the Lord passed through
    Ere he found his sheep that was lost.
  Out in the desert he heard its cry--
  Sick and helpless, and ready to die.

  ""Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way,
    That mark out the mountain track?""
  ""They were shed for one who had gone astray
    Ere the Shepherd could bring him back.""
  ""Lord, whence are thy hands so rent and torn?""
  ""They are piercèd to-night by many a thorn.""

  But all through the mountains, thunder-riven,
    And up from the rocky steep,
  There rose a cry to the gate of heaven,
    ""Rejoice! I have found my sheep!""
  And the angels echoed around the throne,
  ""Rejoice, for the Lord brings back his own!""",THE LOST SHEEP,Divine

MARGARET JUNKIN PRESTON,"Three women crept at break of day
  A-grope along the shadowy way
  Where Joseph's tomb and garden lay.

  With blanch of woe each face was white,
  As the gray Orient's waxing light
  Brought back upon their awe-struck sight

  The sixth-day scene of anguish. Fast
  The starkly standing cross they passed,
  And, breathless, neared the gate at last.

  Each on her throbbing bosom bore
  A burden of such fragrant store
  As never there had lain before.

  Spices, the purest, richest, best,
  That e'er the musky East possessed,
  From Ind to Araby-the-Blest,

  Had they with sorrow-riven hearts
  Searched all Jerusalem's costliest marts
  In quest of,--nards whose pungent arts

  Should the dead sepulchre imbue
  With vital odors through and through:
  'T was all their love had leave to do!

  Christ did not need their gifts; and yet
  Did either Mary once regret
  Her offering? Did Salome fret

  Over the unused aloes? Nay!
  They counted not as waste, that day,
  What they had brought their Lord. The way

  Home seemed the path to heaven. They bare,
  Thenceforth, about the robes they ware
  The clinging perfume everywhere.

  So, ministering as erst did these,
  Go women forth by twos and threes
  (Unmindful of their morning ease),

  Through tragic darkness, murk and dim,
  Where'er they see the faintest rim,
  Of promise,--all for sake of him

  Who rose from Joseph's tomb. They hold
  It just such joy as those of old,
  To tell the tale the Marys told.

  Myrrh-bearers still,--at home, abroad,
  What paths have holy women trod,
  Burdened with votive gifts for God,--

  A cloud receives him from our eyes:
  Gone beyond the highest height
  Of mortal gaze or angel's flight:
  Through the veils of time and space,
  Passed into the holiest place:
  All the toil, the sorrow done,
  All the battle fought and won.

  He is gone; and we return,
  And our hearts within us burn;
  Olivet no more shall greet
  With welcome shout his coming feet:
  Never shall we track him more
  On Gennesareth's glistening shore:
  Never in that look or voice
  Shall Zion's walls again rejoice.

  He is gone; and we remain
  In this world of sin and pain:
  In the void which he has left,
  On this earth of him bereft,
  We have still his work to do,
  We can still his path pursue:
  Seek him both in friend and foe,
  In ourselves his image show.

  He is gone; we heard him say,
  ""Good that I should go away"";
  Gone is that dear form and face,
  But not gone his present grace;
  Though himself no more we see,
  Comfortless we cannot be;
  No! his Spirit still is ours,
  Quickening, freshening all our powers.

  He is gone; towards their goal

  Far behind we leave the past,
  Forward are our glances cast;
  Still his words before us range
  Through the ages, as they change:

  He will give whate'er we need.

  He is gone; but we once more
  Shall behold him as before,
  In the heaven of heavens the same
  As on earth he went and came.
  In the many mansions there
  Place for us he will prepare:
  In that world, unseen, unknown,
  He and we may yet be one.

  He is gone; but not in vain,--
  Wait until he comes again:
  He is risen, he is not here;

JOHN KEBLE,"The midday sun, with fiercest glare,
  Broods over the hazy, twinkling air;
    Along the level sand
  The palm-tree's shade unwavering lies,
  Just as thy towers, Damascus, rise
    To greet yon wearied band.

  The leader of that martial crew
  Seems bent some mighty deed to do,
    So steadily he speeds,
  With lips firm closed and fixed eye,
  Like warrior when the fight is nigh,
    Nor talk nor landscape heeds.

  What sudden blaze is round him poured,
  As though all Heaven's refulgent hoard
    In one rich glory shone?
  One moment,--and to earth he falls:
  What voice his inmost heart appalls?--
    Voice heard by him alone.

  For to the rest both words and form
  Seem lost in lightning and in storm,
    While Saul, in wakeful trance,
  Sees deep within that dazzling field
  His persecuted Lord revealed
    With keen yet pitying glance:

  And hears the meek upbraiding call
  As gently on his spirit fall,
    As if the Almighty Son
  Were prisoner yet in this dark earth,
  Nor had proclaimed his royal birth,
    Nor his great power begun.

  ""Ah! wherefore persecut'st thou me?""
  He heard and saw, and sought to free
    His strained eye from the sight:
  But Heaven's high magic bound it there,
  Still gazing, though untaught to bear
    The insufferable light.

  ""Who art thou, Lord?"" he falters forth:--
  So shall Sin ask of heaven and earth
    At the last awful day
  ""When did we see thee suffering nigh,
  And passed thee with unheeding eye?
    Great God of judgment, say!""

  Ah! little dream our listless eyes
  What glorious presence they despise
    While, in our noon of life,
  To power or fame we rudely press.--
  Christ is at hand, to scorn or bless,
    Christ suffers in our strife.

  And though heaven's gates long since have closed,
  And our dear Lord in bliss reposed,
    High above mortal ken,
  To every ear in every land
  (Though meek ears only understand)
    He speaks as he did then.

  ""Ah! wherefore persecute ye me?
  'T is hard, ye so in love should be
    With your own endless woe.
  Know, though at God's right hand I live,
  I feel each wound ye reckless give
    To the least saint below.

  ""I in your care my brethren left,
  Not willing ye should be bereft
    Of waiting on your Lord.
  The meanest offering ye can make--
  A drop of water--for love's sake,
    In heaven, be sure, is stored.""

  Oh, by those gentle tones and dear,
  When thou hast stayed our wild career,
    Thou only hope of souls,
  Ne'er let us cast one look behind,
  But in the thought of Jesus find
    What every thought controls.

  As to thy last Apostle's heart
  Thy lightning glance did then impart
    Zeal's never-dying fire,
  So teach us on thy shrine to lay
  Our hearts, and let them day by day
    Intenser blaze and higher.

  And as each mild and winning note
  (Like pulses that round harp-strings float
    When the full strain is o'er)
  Left lingering on his inward ear
  Music, that taught, as death drew near,
    Love's lesson more and more:

  So, as we walk our earthly round,
  Still may the echo of that sound
    Be in our memory stored:

  ""Let me hide myself in Thee:""
    Felt her soul no need to hide,--
  Sweet the song as song could be,

    Fell from lips untouched by care,

    On some other lips a prayer,--

    Every syllable a prayer,--

    Let me hide myself in Thee.""

  ""Rock of Ages, cleft for me,""--
    Lips grown agèd sung the hymn
  Trustingly and tenderly,
    Voice grown weak and eyes grown dim,--
  ""Let me hide myself in Thee.""
    Trembling though the voice and low,
  Rose the sweet strain peacefully
    Like a river in its flow;
  Sung as only they can sing
    Who life's thorny path have passed;
  Sung as only they can sing
    Who behold the promised rest,--
  ""Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
    Let me hide myself in Thee.""

  ""Rock of Ages, cleft for me,""
    Sung above a coffin lid;
  Underneath, all restfully,
    All life's joys and sorrows hid.
  Nevermore, O storm-tossed soul!
    Nevermore from wind or tide,
  Nevermore from billow's roll,
    Wilt thou need thyself to hide.

JAMES MONTGOMERY,"Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,
    Uttered or unexpressed--
  The motion of a hidden fire
    That trembles in the breast.

  Prayer is the burthen of a sigh,
    The falling of a tear--
  The upward glancing of an eye,
    When none but God is near.

  Prayer is the simplest form of speech
    That infant lips can try--
  Prayer the sublimest strains that reach
    The majesty on high.

  Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice
    Returning from his ways,
  While angels in their songs rejoice,
    And cry, ""Behold he prays!""

  Prayer is the Christian's vital breath--
    The Christian's native air--
  His watchword at the gates of death--
    He enters heaven with prayer.

  The saints in prayer appear as one
    In word, and deed, and mind,
  While with the Father and the Son
    Sweet fellowship they find.

  Nor prayer is made by man alone--
    The Holy Spirit pleads--
  And Jesus, on the eternal throne,
    For shiners intercedes.

    A thousand years have tolled;
  How glorious must their music be
    As breaks the hallowed day,
  And calleth with a seraph's voice
    A nation up to pray!

  Those chimes that tell a thousand tales,
    Sweet tales of olden time;
  And ring a thousand memories
    At vesper, and at prime!
  At bridal and at burial,
    For cottager and king,
  Those chimes, those glorious Christian chimes,
    How blessedly they ring!

  Those chimes, those chimes of Motherland,
    Upon a Christmas morn.
  Outbreaking as the angels did,
    For a Redeemer born!
  How merrily they call afar,
    To cot and baron's hall,
  With holly decked and mistletoe,
    To keep the festival!

  The chimes of England, how they peal
    From tower and Gothic pile,
  Where hymn and swelling anthem fill
    The dim cathedral aisle;
  Where windows bathe the holy light
    On priestly heads that falls,
  And stains the florid tracery
    Of banner-dighted walls!

  And then, those Easter bells, in spring,
    Those glorious Easter chimes!
  How loyally they hail thee round,

  And sing the rising of the Lord,
    From vale to mountain high.

    Of good old English line:

WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY,"The play is done,--the curtain drops,
    Slow falling to the prompter's bell;
  A moment yet the actor stops,
    And looks around, to say farewell.
  It is an irksome word and task;
    And, when he's laughed and said his say,
  He shows, as he removes the mask,
    A face that's anything but gay.

  One word, ere yet the evening ends,--
    Let's close it with a parting rhyme;
  And pledge a hand to all young friends,
    As flits the merry Christmas time;
  On life's wide scene you, too, have parts
    That fate erelong shall bid you play;
  Good night!--with honest, gentle hearts
    A kindly greeting go alway!

  Good night!--I'd say the griefs, the joys,
    Just hinted in this mimic page,
  The triumphs and defeats of boys,
    Are but repeated in our age;
  I'd say your woes were not less-keen,
    Your hopes more vain, than those of men,--
  Your pangs or pleasures of fifteen
    At forty-five played o'er again.

  I'd say we suffer and we strive
    Not less nor more as men than boys,--
  With grizzled beards at forty-five,
    As erst at twelve in corduroys;
  And if, in time of sacred youth,
    We learned at home to love and pray,
  Pray Heaven that early love and truth
    May never wholly pass away.

  And in the world, as in the school,
    I'd say how fate may change and shift,--
  The prize be sometimes with the fool,
    The race not always to the swift:
  The strong may yield, the good may fall,
    The great man be a vulgar clown,
  The knave be lifted over all,
    The kind cast pitilessly down.

  Who knows the inscrutable design?
    Blessed be Be who took and gave!
  Why should your mother, Charles, not mine,
    Be weeping at her darling's grave?
  We bow to Heaven that willed it so,
    That darkly rules the fate of all,
  That sends the respite or the blow,
    That's free to give or to recall.

  This crowns his feast with wine and wit,--
    Who brought him to that mirth and state?
  His betters, see, below him sit,
    Or hunger hopeless at the gate.
  Who bade the mud from Dives' wheel
    To spurn the rags of Lazarus?
  Come, brother, in that dust we'll kneel,
    Confessing Heaven that ruled it thus.

  So each shall mourn, in life's advance,
    Dear hopes, dear friends, untimely killed;
  Shall grieve for many a forfeit chance
    And longing passion unfulfilled.
  Amen!--whatever fate be sent,
    Pray God the heart may kindly glow,
  Although the head with cares be bent,
    And whitened with the winter snow.

  Come wealth or want, come good or ill,
    Let young and old accept their part,
  And bow before the awful will,
    And bear it with an honest heart.
  Who misses, or who wins the prize,--
    Go, lose or conquer as you can;
  But if you fail, or if you rise,
    Be each, pray God, a gentleman.

  A gentleman, or old or young!
    (Bear kindly with my humble lays;)
  The sacred chorus first was sung
    Upon the first of Christmas days;
  The shepherds heard it overhead,--
    The joyful angels raised it then:
  Glory to Heaven on high, it said,
    And peace on earth to gentle men!

  My song, save this, is little worth;
    I lay the weary pen aside,
  And wish you health and love and mirth,
    As fits the solemn Christmas-tide.
  As fits the holy Christmas birth,
    Be this, good friends, our carol still,--
  Be peace on earth, be peace on earth,

Tangled in the cold moon's hair!
Man and beast lay hurt and screaming,
(Men must die when Kings are dreaming!)--
While within the harried town
Mothers dragged their children down
As the awful rain came screaming,
For the glory of a Crown!

So the Morning flung her cloak
Through the hanging pall of smoke--
Trimmed with red, it was, and dripping with a deep and angry stain!
And the Day came walking then
Through a lane of murdered men,
And her light fell down before her like a Cross upon the plain!
But the forts still crowned the height
With a bitter iron crown!
They had lived to flame and fight,
They had lived to keep the Town!
And they poured their havoc down
All that day ... and all that night....
While four times their number came,
Pawns that played a bloody game!--
With a silver trumpeting,
For the glory of the King,
To the barriers of the thunder and the fury of the flame!

So they stormed the iron Hill,
O'er the sleepers lying still,
And their trumpets sang them forward through the dull succeeding dawns,
But the thunder flung them wide,
And they crumpled up and died,--
They had waged the war of monarchs--and they died the death of pawns.

But the forts still stood.... Their breath
Swept the foeman like a blade,
Though ten thousand men were paid
To the hungry purse of Death,
Though the field was wet with blood,
Still the bold defences stood,
Stood!

And the King came out with his bodyguard at the day's departing gleam--
And the moon rode up behind the smoke and showed the King his dream.",THE BATTLE OF LIÈGE,WAR

There are five men in the moonlight
  That by their shadows stand;
Three hobble humped on crutches,
  And two lack each a hand.

Frogs somewhere near the roadside
  Chorus their chant absorbed:
But a hush breathes out of the dream-light
  That far in heaven is orbed.

It is gentle as sleep falling
  And wide as thought can span,
The ancient peace and wonder
  That brims the heart of man.

Beyond the hills it shines now
  On no peace but the dead,
On reek of trenches thunder-shocked,
Tense fury of wills in wrestle locked,
  A chaos crumbled red!

The five men in the moonlight
  Chat, joke, or gaze apart.
They talk of days and comrades,
  But each one hides his heart.

They wear clean cap and tunic,
  As when they went to war;
A gleam comes where the medal's pinned:
  But they will fight no more.

The shadows, maimed and antic,
  Gesture and shape distort,
Like mockery of a demon dumb
Out of the hell-din whence they come
  That dogs them for his sport:

But as if dead men were risen
  And stood before me there
With a terrible fame about them blown
  In beams of spectral air,

I see them, men transfigured
  As in a dream, dilate
Fabulous with the Titan-throb
  Of battling Europe's fate;

For history's hushed before them,
  And legend flames afresh,--
Verdun, the name of thunder,
  Is written on their flesh.

  As I was passing by,
The gray spires of Oxford
  Against the pearl-gray sky.
My heart was with the Oxford men
  Who went abroad to die.

The years go fast in Oxford,
  The golden years and gay,
The hoary Colleges look down
  On careless boys at play.
But when the bugles sounded war
  They put their games away.

They left the peaceful river,
  The cricket-field, the quad,
The shaven lawns of Oxford,
  To seek a bloody sod--
They gave their merry youth away
  For country and for God.

God rest you, happy gentlemen,
  Who laid your good lives down,
Who took the khaki and the gun
  Instead of cap and gown.
God bring you to a fairer place
  Than even Oxford town.

  Never an eight goes flashing by;
Never a blatant coach on the marge is
  Urging his crew to do or die;
Never the critic we knew enlarges,
  Fluent, on How and Why!

  Welcomed the Football men aglow,
Covered with mud, as you'll remember,
  Eager to vanquish Oxford's foe.
Where are the teams of last December?
  Gone--where they had to go!

Where are her sons who waged at cricket
  Warfare against the foeman-friend?
Far from the Parks, on a harder wicket,
  Still they attack and still defend;
Playing a greater game, they'll stick it,
  Fearless until the end!

Awake, ye nations, slumbering supine,
  Who round enring the European fray!
  Heard ye the trumpet sound? ""The Day! the Day!
The last that shall on England's Empire shine!
The Parliament that broke the Right Divine
  Shall see her realm of reason swept away,
  And lesser nations shall the sword obey--
The sword o'er all carve the great world's design!""

So on the English Channel boasts the foe
  On whose imperial brow death's helmet nods.
Look where his hosts o'er bloody Belgium go,
  And mix a nation's past with blazing sods!
A kingdom's waste! a people's homeless woe!
  Man's broken Word, and violated gods!


II

Far fall the day when England's realm shall see
  The sunset of dominion! Her increase
  Abolishes the man-dividing seas,
And frames the brotherhood on earth to be!
She, in free peoples planting sovereignty,
  Orbs half the civil world in British peace;
  And though time dispossess her, and she cease,
Rome-like she greatens in man's memory.

Oh, many a crown shall sink in war's turmoil,
  And many a new republic light the sky,
Fleets sweep the ocean, nations till the soil,
  Genius be born and generations die.
Orient and Occident together toil,
  Ere such a mighty work man rears on high!

Hearken, the feet of the Destroyer tread
  The wine-press of the nations; fast the blood
  Pours from the side of Europe; in the flood
On the septentrional watershed
The rivers of fair France are running red!
  England, the mother-aerie of our brood,
  That on the summit of dominion stood,
Shakes in the blast: heaven battles overhead!

Lift up thy head, O Rheims, of ages heir
  That treasured up in thee their glorious sum;
Upon whose brow, prophetically fair,
  Flamed the great morrow of the world to come;
Haunt with thy beauty this volcanic air
  Ere yet thou close, O Flower of Christendom!

As when the shadow of the sun's eclipse
  Sweeps on the earth, and spreads a spectral air,
  As if the universe were dying there,
On continent and isle the darkness dips
Unwonted gloom, and on the Atlantic slips;
  So in the night the Belgian cities flare
  Horizon-wide; the wandering people fare
Along the roads, and load the fleeing ships.

And westward borne that planetary sweep
  Darkening o'er England and her times to be,
Already steps upon the ocean-deep!
  Watch well, my country, that unearthly sea,
Lest when thou thinkest not, and in thy sleep,
  Unapt for war, that gloom enshadow thee.

I pray for peace; yet peace is but a prayer.
  How many wars have been in my brief years!
  All races and all faiths, both hemispheres,
My eyes have seen embattled everywhere
The wide earth through; yet do I not despair
  Of peace, that slowly through far ages nears;
  Though not to me the golden morn appears,
My faith is perfect in time's issue fair.

For man doth build on an eternal scale,
  And his ideals are framed of hope deferred;
The millennium came not; yet Christ did not fail,
  Though ever unaccomplished is His word;
Him Prince of Peace, though unenthroned, we hail,
  Supreme when in all bosoms He be heard.


VI

This is my faith, and my mind's heritage,
  Wherein I toil, though in a lonely place,
  Who yet world-wide survey the human race
Unequal from wild nature disengage
Body and soul, and life's old strife assuage;
  Still must abide, till heaven perfect its grace,
  And love grown wisdom sweeten in man's face,
Alike the Christian and the heathen rage.

The tutelary genius of mankind
  Ripens by slow degrees the final State,
That in the soul shall its foundations find
  And only in victorious love grow great;
Patient the heart must be, humble the mind,
  That doth the greater births of time await!


VII

Whence not unmoved I see the nations form
  From Dover to the fountains of the Rhine,
  A hundred leagues, the scarlet battle-line,
And by the Vistula great armies swarm,
A vaster flood; rather my breast grows warm,
  Seeing all peoples of the earth combine
  Under one standard, with one countersign,
Grown brothers in the universal storm.

And never through the wide world yet there rang
  A mightier summons! O Thou who from the side
Of Athens and the loins of Casar sprang,
  Strike, Europe, with half the coming world allied
For those ideals for which, since Homer sang,
  The hosts of thirty centuries have died.","

","
Before I knew, the Dawn was on the road,
Close at my side, so silently he came
Nor gave a sign of salutation, save
To touch with light my sleeve and make the way
Appear as if a shining countenance
Had looked on it. Strange was this radiant Youth,
As I, to these fair, fertile parts of France,
Where Caesar with his legions once had passed,
And where the Kaiser's Uhlans yet would pass
Or e'er another moon should cope with clouds
For mastery of these same fields.--To-night
(And but a month has gone since I walked there)
Well might the Kaiser write, as Caesar wrote,
In his new Commentaries on a Gallic war,
""_Fortissimi Belgae_.""--A moon ago!
Who would have then divined that dead would lie
Like swaths of grain beneath the harvest moon
Upon these lands the ancient Belgae held,
From Normandy beyond renowned Liège!--

But it was out of that dread August night
From which all Europe woke to war, that we,
This beautiful Dawn-Youth, and I, had come,
He from afar. Beyond grim Petrograd
He'd waked the moujik from his peaceful dreams,
Bid the muezzin call to morning prayer
Where minarets rise o'er the Golden Horn,
And driven shadows from the Prussian march
To lie beneath the lindens of the _stadt_.
Softly he'd stirred the bells to ring at Rheims,
He'd knocked at high Montmartre, hardly asleep;
Heard the sweet carillon of doomed Louvain,
Boylike, had tarried for a moment's play
Amid the traceries of Amiens,
And then was hast'ning on the road to Dieppe,
When he o'ertook me drowsy from the hours
Through which I'd walked, with no companions else
Than ghostly kilometer posts that stood
As sentinels' of space along the way.--
Often, in doubt, I'd paused to question one,
With nervous hands, as they who read Moon-type;
And more than once I'd caught a moment's sleep
Beside the highway, in the dripping grass,
While one of these white sentinels stood guard,
Knowing me for a friend, who loves the road,
And best of all by night, when wheels do sleep
And stars alone do walk abroad.--But once
Three watchful shadows, deeper than the dark,
Laid hands on me and searched me for the marks
Of traitor or of spy, only to find
Over my heart the badge of loyalty.--
With wish for _bon voyage_ they gave me o'er
To the white guards who led me on again.

Thus Dawn o'ertook me and with magic speech
Made me forget the night as we strode on.
Where'er he looked a miracle was wrought:
A tree grew from the darkness at a glance;
A hut was thatched; a new chateau was reared
Of stone, as weathered as the church at Caen;
Gray blooms were coloured suddenly in red;
A flag was flung across the eastern sky.--
Nearer at hand, he made me then aware
Of peasant women bending in the fields,
Cradling and gleaning by the first scant light,
Their sons and husbands somewhere o'er the edge
Of these green-golden fields which they had sowed,
But will not reap,--out somewhere on the march,
God but knows where and if they come again.
One fallow field he pointed out to me
Where but the day before a peasant ploughed,
Dreaming of next year's fruit, and there his plough
Stood now mid-field, his horses commandeered,
A monstrous sable crow perched on the beam.

Before I knew, the Dawn was on the road,
Far from my side, so silently he went,
Catching his golden helmet as he ran,
And hast'ning on along the dun straight way,
Where old men's sabots now began to clack
And withered women, knitting, led their cows,
On, on to call the men of Kitchener
Down to their coasts,--I shouting after him:
""O Dawn, would you had let the world sleep on
Till all its armament were turned to rust,
Nor waked it to this day of hideous hate,
Of man's red murder and of woman's woe!""

Famished and lame, I came at last to Dieppe,
But Dawn had made his way across the sea,
And, as I climbed with heavy feet the cliff,
Was even then upon the sky-built towers
Of that great capital where nations all,
Teuton, Italian, Gallic, English, Slav,
Forget long hates in one consummate faith.

","T was in the piping tune of peace
We trod the sacred soil of Greece,
Nor thought, where the Ilissus runs,
Of Teuton craft or Teuton guns;

Nor dreamt that, ere the year was spent,
Their iron challenge insolent
Would round the world's horizons pour,
From Europe to the Australian shore.

The tides of war had ebb'd away
From Trachis and Thermopylae,
Long centuries had come and gone
Since that fierce day at Marathon;

Freedom was firmly based, and we
Wall'd by our own encircling sea;
The ancient passions dead, and men
Battl'd with ledger and with pen.

So seem'd it, but to them alone
The wisdom of the gods is known;
Lest freedom's price decline, from far
Zeus hurl'd the thunderbolt of war.

And so once more the Persian steel
The armies of the Greeks must feel,
And once again a Xerxes know
The virtue of a Spartan foe.

Thus may the cloudy fates unroll'd
Retrace the starry circles old,
And the recurrent heavens decree
A Periclean dynasty.

It was silent in the street.
I did not know until a woman told me,
Sobbing over the muslin she sold me.
Then I went out and walked to the square
And saw a few dazed people standing there.

And then the drums beat, the drums beat!
O then the drums beat!
And hurrying, stumbling through the street
Came the hurrying stumbling feet.
O I have heard the drums beat
For war!
I have heard the townsfolk come,
I have heard the roll and thunder of the nearest drum
As the drummer stopped and cried, ""Hear!
Be strong! The summons comes! Prepare!""
Closing he prayed us to be calm....

And there was calm in my heart of the desert, of the dead sea,
Of vast plains of the West before the coming storm,
And there was calm in their eyes like the last calm that shall be.

And then the drum beat,
The fatal drum, beat,
And the drummer marched through the street
And down to another square,
And the drummer above took up the beat
And sent it onward where
Huddled, we stood and heard the drums roll,
And then a bell began to toll.

O I have heard the thunder of drums
Crashing into simple poor homes.
I have heard the drums roll ""Farewell!""
I have heard the tolling cathedral bell.
Will it ever peal again?
Shall I ever smile or feel again?
What was joy? What was pain?

I have seen the drummer striding from street to street,
Crying, ""Be strong! Hear what I must tell!""
While the drums roared and rolled and beat

Rough and strong they are, proud and gay they are.

Except for the weeping of the ruddy old women of Finistère.
The younger women do not weep. They dream and stare.

They seem to be walking in dreams. They seem not to know
It is their homes, their happiness, vanishing so.

But never before when War was walking the world's highways.

  The pyre of Dido on the vacant shore;
  I see Medea's fury and hear the roar
Of rushing flames, the new bride's burning tears;
And ever as still another vision peers
  Thro' memory's mist to stir me more and more,
  I say that surely I have lived before
And known this joy and trembled with these fears.

The passion that they show me burns so high;
  Their love, in me who have not looked on love,

To chant our feeble Litanies,
  To think sweet thoughts, to do good deeds.
The altar lights grow pale and dim,
  The bells hang silent in the tower--
So passes with the dying hymn
  Our little hour.

","At last there'll dawn the last of the long year,
Of the long year that seemed to dream no end,
Whose every dawn but turned the world more drear,
And slew some hope, or led away some friend.
Or be you dark, or buffeting, or blind,
We care not, day, but leave not death behind.

The hours that feed on war go heavy-hearted,
Death is no fare wherewith to make hearts fain.
Oh, we are sick to find that they who started
With glamour in their eyes came not again.
O day, be long and heavy if you will,
But on our hopes set not a bitter heel.

For tiny hopes like tiny flowers of Spring
Will come, though death and ruin hold the land,
Though storms may roar they may not break the wing
Of the earthed lark whose song is ever bland.
Fell year unpitiful, slow days of scorn,
Your kind shall die, and sweeter days be born.","

Around no fire the soldiers sleep to-night,
  But lie a-wearied on the ice-bound field,
  With cloaks wrapt round their sleeping forms, to shield
Them from the northern winds. Ere comes the light
Of morn brave men must arm, stern foes to fight.
  The sentry stands, his limbs with cold congealed;
  His head a-nod with sleep; he cannot yield,
Though sleep and snow in deadly force unite.

Amongst the sleepers lies the Boy awake,
  And wide-eyed plans brave glories that transcend
  The deeds of heroes dead; then dreams o'ertake
His tired-out brain, and lofty fancies blend
To one grand theme, and through all barriers break
  To guard from hurt his faithful sleeping friend.",THE BATTLEFIELD,WAR

Quiet thou didst stand at thine appointed place,
There was no press to purchase--younger grace
Attracts the youth of valour. Thou didst not know,
Like the old, kindly Martha, to and fro
To haste. Yet one could say, ""In thine I prize
The strength of calm that held in Mary's eyes.""
And when they came, thy gracious smile so wrought
They knew that they were given, not that they bought.
Thou didst not tempt to vauntings, and pretence
Was dumb before thy perfect woman's sense.
Blest who have seen, for they shall ever see
The radiance of thy benignity.","

A bowl of daffodils,
A crimson-quilted bed,
Sheets and pillows white as snow--
White and gold and red--
And sisters moving to and fro,
With soft and silent tread.

So all my spirit fills
With pleasure infinite,
And all the feathered wings of rest
Seem flocking from the radiant West
To bear me thro' the night.

See, how they close me in.
They, and the sisters' arms.
One eye is closed, the other lid
Is watching how my spirit slid
Toward some red-roofed farms,
And having crept beneath them slept
Secure from war's alarms.","

_John Finley_,"Wherever war, with its red woes,
Or flood, or fire, or famine goes,
    There, too, go I;
If earth in any quarter quakes
Or pestilence its ravage makes,
    Thither I fly.

I kneel behind the soldier's trench,
I walk 'mid shambles' smear and stench,
    The dead I mourn;
I bear the stretcher and I bend
O'er Fritz and Pierre and Jack to mend
    What shells have torn.

I go wherever men may dare,
I go wherever woman's care
    And love can live,
Wherever strength and skill can bring
Surcease to human suffering,
    Or solace give.

With Hospitaller Knights I bore

I was the Lady of the Lamp;

I am your bodies on their rounds
    Of pain afar:
I am _you_, doing what you would
If you were only where you could--
    Your avatar.

The flag which o'er my breast I bear,

Look! Where the hell of steel has torn
Its way through slumbering earth

And wonder at their birth.

With smile and guiding hand,

_Wilfrid Wilson Gibson_","
When consciousness came back, he found he lay
Between the opposing fires, but could not tell
On which hand were his friends; and either way
For him to turn was chancy--bullet and shell
Whistling and shrieking over him, as the glare
Of searchlights scoured the darkness to blind day.
He scrambled to his hands and knees ascare,
Dragging his wounded foot through puddled clay,
And tumbled in a hole a shell had scooped
At random in a turnip-field between
The unseen trenches where the foes lay cooped
Through that unending-battle of unseen,
Dead-locked, league-stretching armies; and quite spent
He rolled upon his back within the pit,
And lay secure, thinking of all it meant--
His lying in that little hole, sore hit,
But living, while across the starry sky
Shrapnel and shell went screeching overhead--
Of all it meant that he, Tom Dodd, should lie
Among the Belgian turnips, while his bed....
If it were he, indeed, who'd climbed each night,
Fagged with the day's work, up the narrow stair,
And slipt his clothes off in the candle-light,
Too tired to fold them neatly in a chair
The way his mother'd taught him--too dog-tired
After the long day's serving in the shop,
Inquiring what each customer required,
Politely talking weather, fit to drop....

And now for fourteen days and nights, at least,
He hadn't had his clothes off, and had lain
In muddy trenches, napping like a beast
With one eye open, under sun and rain
And that unceasing hell-fire....
                                  It was strange
How things turned out--the chances! You'd just got
To take your luck in life, you couldn't change
Your luck.
                And so here he was lying shot
Who just six months ago had thought to spend
His days behind a counter. Still, perhaps....
And now, God only knew how he would end!

He'd like to know how many of the chaps
Had won back to the trench alive, when he
Had fallen wounded and been left for dead,
If any!...
                This was different, certainly,
From selling knots of tape and reels of thread
And knots of tape and reels of thread and knots
Of tape and reels of thread and knots of tape,
Day in, day out, and answering ""Have you got""'s
And ""Do you keep""'s till there seemed no escape
From everlasting serving in a shop,
Inquiring what each customer required,
Politely talking weather, fit to drop,
With swollen ankles, tired....
                                But he was tired
Now. Every bone was aching, and had ached
For fourteen days and nights in that wet trench--
Just duller when he slept than when he waked--
Crouching for shelter from the steady drench
Of shell and shrapnel....
                        That old trench, it seemed
Almost like home to him. He'd slept and fed
And sung and smoked in it, while shrapnel screamed
And shells went whining harmless overhead--
Harmless, at least, as far as he....
                                     But Dick--
Dick hadn't found them harmless yesterday,
At breakfast, when he'd said he couldn't stick
Eating dry bread, and crawled out the back way,
And brought them butter in a lordly dish--
Butter enough for all, and held it high,
Yellow and fresh and clean as you would wish--
When plump upon the plate from out the sky
A shell fell bursting.... Where the butter went,
God only knew!...
              And Dick.... He dared not think
Of what had come to Dick.... or what it meant--
The shrieking and the whistling and the stink
He'd lived in fourteen days and nights. 'T was luck
That he still lived.... And queer how little then
He seemed to care that Dick.... perhaps 't was pluck
That hardened him--a man among the men--
Perhaps.... Yet, only think things out a bit,
And he was rabbit-livered, blue with funk!
And he'd liked Dick ... and yet when Dick was hit
He hadn't turned a hair. The meanest skunk
He should have thought would feel it when his mate
Was blown to smithereens--Dick, proud as punch,
Grinning like sin, and holding up the plate--
But he had gone on munching his dry hunch,
Unwinking, till he swallowed the last crumb.
Perhaps 't was just because he dared not let
His mind run upon Dick, who'd been his chum.
He dared not now, though he could not forget.

Dick took his luck. And, life or death, 't was luck
From first to last; and you'd just got to trust
Your luck and grin. It wasn't so much pluck
As knowing that you'd got to, when needs must,
And better to die grinning....
                                  Quiet now
Had fallen on the night. On either hand
The guns were quiet. Cool upon his brow
The quiet darkness brooded, as he scanned
The starry sky. He'd never seen before
So many stars. Although, of course, he'd known
That there were stars, somehow before the war
He'd never realised them--so thick-sown,
Millions and millions. Serving in the shop,
Stars didn't count for much; and then at nights
Strolling the pavements, dull and fit to drop,
You didn't see much but the city lights.
He'd never in his life seen so much sky
As he'd seen this last fortnight. It was queer
The things war taught you. He'd a mind to try
To count the stars--they shone so bright and clear.

One, two, three, four.... Ah, God, but he was tired....
Five, six, seven, eight....
                            Yes, it was number eight.
And what was the next thing that she required?
(Too bad of customers to come so late,
At closing time!) Again within the shop
He handled knots of tape and reels of thread,
Politely talking weather, fit to drop....

When once again the whole sky overhead
Flared blind with searchlights, and the shriek of shell
And scream of shrapnel roused him. Drowsily
He stared about him, wondering. Then he fell
Into deep dreamless slumber.

       *       *       *       *       *

                               He could see
Two dark eyes peeping at him, ere he knew
He was awake, and it again was day--
An August morning, burning to clear blue.
The frightened rabbit scuttled....
                                    Far away,
A sound of firing.... Up there, in the sky
Big dragon-flies hung hovering.... Snowballs burst
About them.... Flies and snowballs. With a cry
He crouched to watch the airmen pass--the first
That he'd seen under fire. Lord, that was pluck--
Shells bursting all about them--and what nerve!
They took their chance, and trusted to their luck.
At such a dizzy height to dip and swerve,
Dodging the shell-fire....
                           Hell! but one was hit,
And tumbling like a pigeon, plump....
                                  Thank Heaven,
It righted, and then turned; and after it
The whole flock followed safe--four, five, six, seven,
Yes, they were all there safe. He hoped they'd win
Back to their lines in safety. They deserved,
Even if they were Germans.... 'T was no sin
To wish them luck. Think how that beggar swerved
Just in the nick of time!
                          He, too, must try
To win back to the lines, though, likely as not,
He'd take the wrong turn: but he couldn't lie
Forever in that hungry hole and rot,
He'd got to take his luck, to take his chance
Of being sniped by foes or friends. He'd be
With any luck in Germany or France
Or Kingdom-come, next morning....
                                  Drearily
The blazing day burnt over him, shot and shell
Whistling and whining ceaselessly. But light
Faded at last, and as the darkness fell
He rose, and crawled away into the night.","
BETWEEN THE LINES",WAR
"_Robert Haven Schauffler_
","Under our curtain of fire,
Over the clotted clods,
We charged, to be withered, to reel
And despairingly wheel
When the bugles bade us retire
From the terrible odds.

As we ebbed with the battle-tide,
Fingers of red-hot steel
Suddenly closed on my side.
I fell, and began to pray.
I crawled on my hands and lay
Where a shallow crater yawned wide;
Then,--I swooned....

When I woke, it was yet day.
Fierce was the pain of my wound,
But I saw it was death to stir,
For fifty paces away
Their trenches were.
In torture I prayed for the dark
And the stealthy step of my friend
Who, staunch to the very end,
Would creep to the danger zone
And offer his life as a mark
To save my own.

Night fell. I heard his tread,
Not stealthy, but firm and serene,
As if my comrade's head
Were lifted far from that scene
Of passion and pain and dread;
As if my comrade's heart
In carnage took no part;
As if my comrade's feet
Were set on some radiant street
Such as no darkness might haunt;
As if my comrade's eyes,
No deluge of flame could surprise,
No death and destruction daunt,
No red-beaked bird dismay,
Nor sight of decay.

Then in the bursting shells' dim light
I saw he was clad in white.
For a moment I thought that I saw the smock
Of a shepherd in search of his flock.
Alert were the enemy, too,
And their bullets flew
Straight at a mark no bullet could fail;
For the seeker was tall and his robe was bright;
But he did not flee nor quail.
Instead, with unhurrying stride
He came,
And gathering my tall frame,
Like a child, in his arms....

Again I swooned,
And awoke
From a blissful dream
In a cave by a stream.
My silent comrade had bound my side.
No pain now was mine, but a wish that I spoke,--
A mastering wish to serve this man
Who had ventured through hell my doom to revoke,
As only the truest of comrades can.
I begged him to tell me how best I might aid him,
And urgently prayed him
Never to leave me, whatever betide;
When I saw he was hurt--
Shot through the hands that were clasped in prayer!
Then, as the dark drops gathered there
And fell in the dirt,
The wounds of my friend
Seemed to me such as no man might bear.
Those bullet-holes in the patient hands
Seemed to transcend
All horrors that ever these war-drenched lands
Had known or would know till the mad world's end.
Then suddenly I was aware
That his feet had been wounded, too;
And, dimming the white of his side,
A dull stain grew.
""You are hurt, White Comrade!"" I cried.
His words I already foreknew:
""These are old wounds,"" said he,
""But of late they have troubled me.""",THE WHITE COMRADE,WAR

Here, where we stood together, we three men,
  Before the war had swept us to the East
Three thousand miles away, I stand again
  And bear the bells, and breathe, and go to feast.
We trod the same path, to the selfsame place,
  Yet here I stand, having beheld their graves,
Skyros whose shadows the great seas erase,
  And Seddul Bahr that ever more blood craves.
So, since we communed here, our bones have been
  Nearer, perhaps, than they again will be,
Earth and the worldwide battle lie between,
  Death lies between, and friend-destroying sea.
Yet here, a year ago, we talked and stood
As I stand now, with pulses beating blood.

I saw her like a shadow on the sky
  In the last light, a blur upon the sea,
Then the gale's darkness put the shadow by,
  But from one grave that island talked to me;
And, in the midnight, in the breaking storm,
  I saw its blackness and a blinking light,
And thought, ""So death obscures your gentle form,
  So memory strives to make the darkness bright;
And, in that heap of rocks, your body lies,
  Part of the island till the planet ends,

We fell, we lay, we slumbered, we took rest,

Freed of the heavy dreams of hearts afar.
We rose at last under the morning star.
We rose, and greeted our brothers, and welcomed our foes.
We rose; like the wheat when the wind is over, we rose.
With shouts we rose, with gasps and incredulous cries,
With bursts of singing, and silence, and awestruck eyes,

    When shall I come to thee?
  When shall my sorrows have an end--
    Thy joys when shall I see?
  O happy harbor of God's saints!
    O sweet and pleasant soil!
  In thee no sorrows can be found--
    No grief, no care, no toil.

  In thee no sickness is at all,
    No hurt, nor any sore;
  There is no death nor ugly night,
    But life for evermore.
  No dimming cloud o'ershadows thee,
    No cloud nor darksome night,
  But every soul shines as the sun--
    For God himself gives light.

  There lust and lucre cannot dwell,
    There envy bears no sway;
  There is no hunger, thirst, nor heat.
    But pleasures every way.
  Jerusalem! Jerusalem!
    Would God I were in thee!
  Oh! that my sorrows had an end,
    Thy joys that I might see!

  No pains, no pangs, no grieving griefs,
    No woful night is there;
  No sigh, no sob, no cry is heard--
    No well-away, no fear.
  Jerusalem the city is
    Of God our king alone;
  The Lamb of God, the light thereof,
    Sits there upon His throne.

  O God! that I Jerusalem
    With speed may go behold!
  For why? the pleasures there abound
    Which here cannot be told.
  Thy turrets and thy pinnacles
    With carbuncles do shine--
  With jasper, pearl, and chrysolite,
    Surpassing pure and fine.

  Thy houses are of ivory,
    Thy windows crystal clear,
  Thy streets are laid with beaten gold--
    There angels do appear.
  Thy walls are made of precious stone,
    Thy bulwarks diamond square,
  Thy gates are made of orient pearl--
    O God! if I were there!

  Within thy gates no thing can come
    That is not passing clean;
  No spider's web, no dirt, nor dust,
    No filth may there be seen.
  Jehovah, Lord, now come away,
    And end my griefs and plaints--
  Take me to Thy Jerusalem,
    And place me with Thy saints!

  Who there are crowned with glory great,
    And see God face to face,
  They triumph still, and aye rejoice--
    Most happy is their case.
  But we that are in banishment,
    Continually do moan;
  We sigh, we mourn, we sob, we weep--
    Perpetually we groan.

  Our sweetness mixèd is with gall,
    Our pleasures are but pain,
  Our joys not worth the looking on--
    Our sorrows aye remain.
  But there they live in such delight,
    Such pleasure and such play,
  That unto them a thousand years
    Seems but as yesterday.

  O my sweet home, Jerusalem!
    Thy joys when shall I see--
  The King sitting upon His throne,
    And thy felicity?
  Thy vineyards, and thy orchards,
    So wonderfully rare,
  Are furnished with all kinds of fruit,
    Most beautifully fair.

  Thy gardens and thy goodly walks
    Continually are green;
  There grow such sweet and pleasant flowers
    As nowhere else are seen.
  There cinnamon and sugar grow,
    There nard and balm abound;
  No tongue can tell, no heart can think,
    The pleasures there are found.

  There nectar and ambrosia spring--
    There music's ever sweet;
  There many a fair and dainty thing
    Are trod down under feet.
  Quite through the streets, with pleasant sound,
    The flood of life doth flow;
  Upon the banks, on every side,
    The trees of life do grow.

  These trees each month yield ripened fruit--
    For evermore they spring;
  And all the nations of the world
    To thee their honors bring.
  Jerusalem, God's dwelling-place,
    Full sore I long to see;
  Oh! that my sorrows had an end,
    That I might dwell in thee!

  There David stands, with harp in hand,
    As master of the choir;
  A thousand times that man were blest
    That might his music hear.
  There Mary sings ""Magnificat,""
    With tunes surpassing sweet;
  And all the virgins bear their part,
    Singing around her feet.

  ""Te Deum,"" doth Saint Ambrose sing,
    Saint Austin doth the like;
  Old Simeon and Zacharie
    Have not their songs to seek.
  There Magdalene hath left her moan,
    And cheerfully doth sing,
  With all blest saints whose harmony
    Through every street doth ring.

  Jerusalem! Jerusalem!
    Thy joys fain would I see;
  Come quickly, Lord, and end my grief,
    And take me home to Thee;
  Oh! paint Thy name on my forehead,
    And take me hence away,
  That I may dwell with Thee in bliss,
    And sing Thy praises aye.

  Jerusalem, the happy home--
    Jehovah's throne on high!
  O sacred city, queen, and wife
    Of Christ eternally!
  O comely queen with glory clad,
    With honor and degree,
  All fair thou art, exceeding bright--
    No spot there is in thee!

  I long to see Jerusalem,
    The comfort of us all;
  For thou art fair and beautiful--
    None ill can thee befall.
  In thee, Jerusalem, I say,
    No darkness dare appear--
  No night, no shade, no winter foul--
    No time doth alter there.

  No candle needs, no moon to shine,
    No glittering star to light;
  For Christ, the king of righteousness,
    For ever shineth bright.
  A lamb unspotted, white and pure,
    To thee doth stand in lieu
  Of light--so great the glory is
    Thine heavenly king to view.

  He is the King of kings beset
    In midst His servants' sight:
  And they, His happy household all,
    Do serve Him day and night.
  There, there the choir of angels sing--
    There the supernal sort
  Of citizens, which hence are rid
    From dangers deep, do sport.

  There be the prudent prophets all,
    The apostles six and six,
  The glorious martyrs in a row,
    And confessors betwixt.
  There doth the crew of righteous men
    And matrons all consist--
  Young men and maids that here on earth
    Their pleasures did resist.

  The sheep and lambs, that hardly 'scaped
    The snare of death and hell,
  Triumph in joy eternally,
    Whereof no tongue can tell;
  And though the glory of each one
    Doth differ in degree,
  Yet is the joy of all alike
    And common, as we see.

  There love and charity do reign,
    And Christ is all in all,
  Whom they most perfectly behold
    In joy celestial.
  They love, they praise--they praise, they love;
    They ""Holy, holy,"" cry;
  They neither toil, nor faint, nor end,
    But laud continually.

  Oh! happy thousand times were I,
    If, after wretched days,
  I might with listening ears conceive
    Those heavenly songs of praise,
  Which to the eternal king are sung
    By happy wights above--
  By savèd souls and angels sweet,
    Who love the God of love.

  Oh! passing happy were my state,
    Might I be worthy found
  To wait upon my God and king,
    His praises there to sound;
  And to enjoy my Christ above,
    His favor and His grace,
  According to His promise made,
    Which here I interlace:

  ""O Father dear,"" quoth He, ""let them
    Which Thou hast put of old
  To me, be there where lo! I am--
    Thy glory to behold;
  Which I with Thee, before the world
    Was made in perfect wise,
  Have had--from whence the fountain great
    Of glory doth arise.""

  Again: ""If any man will serve
    Thee, let him follow me;
  For where I am, he there, right sure,
    Then shall my servant be.""
  And still: ""If any man loves me,
    Him loves my Father dear,
  Whom I do love--to him myself
    In glory will appear.""

  Lord, take away my misery,
    That then I may be bold
  With Thee, in Thy Jerusalem,
    Thy glory to behold;
  And so in Zion see my king,
    My love, my Lord, my all--
  Where now as in a glass I see,
    There face to face I shall.

  Oh! blessèd are the pure in heart--
    Their sovereign they shall see;
  O ye most happy, heavenly wights,
    Which of God's household be!
  O Lord, with speed dissolve my bands,
    These gins and fetters strong;
  For I have dwelt within the tents
    Of Kedar over long.

  Yet search me, Lord, and find me out!
    Fetch me Thy fold unto,
  That all Thy angels may rejoice,
    While all Thy will I do.
  O mother dear! Jerusalem!
    When shall I come to thee?
  When shall my sorrows have an end,
    Thy joys when shall I see?

  Yet once again I pray Thee, Lord,
    To quit me from all strife,
  That to Thy hill I may attain,
    And dwell there all my life--
  With cherubim and seraphim
    And holy souls of men,
  To sing Thy praise, O God of hosts!

JOHN MASON NEALE," The world is very evil,
    The times are waxing late;
  Be sober and keep vigil,
    The Judge is at the gate,--
  The Judge that comes in mercy,
    The Judge that comes with might,
  To terminate the evil,
    To diadem the right.
  When the just and gentle Monarch
    Shall summon from the tomb,
  Let man, the guilty, tremble,
    For Man, the God, shall doom!

  Arise, arise, good Christian,
    Let right to wrong succeed;
  Let penitential sorrow
    To heavenly gladness lead,--
  To the light that hath no evening,
    That knows nor moon nor sun,
  The light so new and golden,
    The light that is but one.

  And when the Sole-Begotten
    Shall render up once more
  The kingdom to the Father,
    Whose own it was before,
  Then glory yet unheard of
    Shall shed abroad its ray,
  Resolving all enigmas,
    An endless Sabbath-day.

  For thee, O dear, dear Country!
    Mine eyes their vigils keep;
  For very love, beholding
    Thy happy name, they weep.
  The mention of thy glory
    Is unction to the breast,
  And medicine in sickness,
    And love, and life, and rest.

  O one, O only Mansion!
    O Paradise of Joy,
  Where tears are ever banished,
    And smiles have no alloy!
  Beside thy living waters
    All plants are, great and small,
  The cedar of the forest,
    The hyssop of the wall;
  With jaspers glow thy bulwarks,
    Thy streets with emeralds blaze,
  The sardius and the topaz
    Unite in thee their rays;
  Thine ageless walls are bonded
    With amethyst unpriced;
  Thy Saints build up its fabric,
    And the corner-stone is Christ.

  The Cross is all thy splendor,
    The Crucified thy praise;
  His laud and benediction
    Thy ransomed people raise:
  ""Jesus, the gem of Beauty,
    True God and Man,"" they sing,
  ""The never-failing Garden,
    The ever-golden Ring;
  The Door, the Pledge, the Husband,
    The Guardian of his Court;
  The Day-star of Salvation,
    The Porter and the Port!""

  Thou hast no shore, fair ocean!
    Thou hast no time, bright day!
  Dear fountain of refreshment
    To pilgrims far away!
  Upon the Rock of Ages
    They raise thy holy tower;
  Thine is the victor's laurel,
    And thine the golden dower!

  Thou feel'st in mystic rapture,
    O Bride that know'st no guile,
  The Prince's sweetest kisses,
    The Prince's loveliest smile;
  Unfading lilies, bracelets
    Of living pearl thine own;
  The Lamb is ever near thee,
    The Bridegroom thine alone.
  The Crown is he to guerdon,
    The Buckler to protect,
  And he himself the Mansion,
    And he the Architect.

  The only art thou needest--
    Thanksgiving for thy lot;
  The only joy thou seekest--
    The Life where Death is not.
  And all thine endless leisure,
    In sweetest accents, sings
  The ill that was thy merit,
    The wealth that is thy King's!

  Jerusalem the golden,
    With milk and honey blest,
  Beneath thy contemplation
    Sink heart and voice oppressed.
  I know not, O I know not,
    What social joys are there!
  What radiancy of glory,
    What light beyond compare!

  And when I fain would sing them,
    My spirit fails and faints;
  And vainly would it image
    The assembly of the Saints.

  They stand, those halls of Zion,
    Conjubilant with song,
  And bright with many an angel,
    And all the martyr throng;
  The Prince is ever in them,
    The daylight is serene;
  The pastures of the Blessèd
    Are decked in glorious sheen.

  There is the Throne of David,
    And there, from care released,
  The song of them that triumph,
    The shout of them that feast;
  And they who, with their Leader,
    Have conquered in the fight,
  Forever and forever
    Are clad in robes of white!

  O holy, placid harp-notes
    Of that eternal hymn!
  O sacred, sweet reflection,
    And peace of Seraphim!
  O thirst, forever ardent,
    Yet evermore content!
  O true peculiar vision
    Of God cunctipotent!
  Ye know the many mansions
    For many a glorious name,
  And divers retributions
    That divers merits claim;
  For midst the constellations
    That deck our earthly sky,
  This star than that is brighter--
    And so it is on high.

  Jerusalem the glorious!
    The glory of the Elect!
  O dear and future vision
    That eager hearts expect!
  Even now by faith I see thee,
    Even here thy walls discern;
  To thee my thoughts are kindled,
    And strive, and pant, and yearn.

  Jerusalem the only,
    That look'st from heaven below,
  In thee is all my glory,
    In me is all my woe;
  And though my body may not,
    My spirit seeks thee fain,
  Till flesh and earth return me
    To earth and flesh again.

  O none can tell thy bulwarks,
    How gloriously they rise!
  O none can tell thy capitals
    Of beautiful device!
  Thy loveliness oppresses
    All human thought and heart;
  And none, O peace, O Zion,
    Can sing thee as thou art!

  New mansion of new people,
    Whom God's own love and light
  Promote, increase, make holy,
    Identify, unite!
  Thou City of the Angels!
    Thou City of the Lord!
  Whose everlasting music
    Is the glorious decachord!

  And there the band of Prophets
    United praise ascribes,
  And there the twelvefold chorus
    Of Israel's ransomed tribes.
  The lily-beds of virgins,
    The roses' martyr-glow,
  The cohort of the Fathers
    Who kept the faith below.

  And there the Sole-Begotten
    Is Lord in regal state,--
  He, Judah's mystic Lion,
    He, Lamb Immaculate.
  O fields that know no sorrow!
    O state that fears no strife!
  O princely bowers! O land of flowers!
    O realm and home of Life!

  Jerusalem, exulting
    On that securest shore,
  I hope thee, wish thee, sing thee,
    And love thee evermore!
  I ask not for my merit,
    I seek not to deny
  My merit is destruction,
    A child of wrath am I;
  But yet with faith I venture
    And hope upon my way;
  For those perennial guerdons
    I labor night and day.

  The best and dearest Father,
    Who made me and who saved,
  Bore with me in defilement,
    And from defilement laved,
  When in his strength I struggle,
    For very joy I leap,
  When in my sin I totter,
    I weep, or try to weep:
  Then grace, sweet grace celestial,
    Shall all its love display,
  And David's Royal Fountain
    Purge every sin away.

  O mine, my golden Zion!
    O lovelier far than gold,
  With laurel-girt battalions,
    And safe victorious fold!
  O sweet and blessèd Country,
    Shall I ever see thy face?
  O sweet and blessèd Country,
    Shall I ever win thy grace?
  I have the hope within me
    To comfort and to bless!
  Shall I ever win the prize itself?

    To bear the scourging of life's rods;

    No broken sunshine there:
  One everlasting stretch of azure pours
  Its stainless splendor o'er those sinless shores;
  For there Jehovah shines with heavenly ray,
  And Jesus reigns, dispensing endless day.

  The dwellers there are not like those of earth,--
    No mortal stain they bear,--
  And yet they seem of kindred blood and birth;
    Whence and how came they there?
  Earth was their native soil; from sin and shame,
  Through tribulation, they to glory came;
  Bond-slaves delivered from sin's crushing load,
  Brands plucked from burning by the hand of God.

  Yon robes of theirs are not like those below;
    No angel's half so bright;
  Whence came that beauty, whence that living glow,
    And whence that radiant white?
  Washed in the blood of the atoning Lamb,
  Fair as the light these robes of theirs became;
  And now, all tears wiped off from every eye,
  They wander where the freshest pastures lie,
  Through all the nightless day of that unfading sky!

  How shall I know thee in the sphere which keeps
    The disembodied spirits of the dead,
  When all of thee that time could wither sleeps
    And perishes among the dust we tread?

  For I shall feel the sting of ceaseless pain
    If there I meet thy gentle presence not;
  Nor hear the voice I love, nor read again
    In thy serenest eyes the tender thought.

  Will not thy own meek heart demand me there?
    That heart whose fondest throbs to me were given;
  My name on earth was ever in thy prayer,
    And wilt thou never utter it in heaven?

  In meadows fanned by heaven's life-breathing wind,
    In the resplendence of that glorious sphere,
  And larger movements of the unfettered mind,
    Wilt thou forget the love that joined us here?

  The love that lived through all the stormy past,
    And meekly with my harsher nature bore,
  And deeper grew, and tenderer to the last.
    Shall it expire with life, and be no more?

  A happier lot than mine, and larger light,
    Await thee there; for thou hast bowed thy will
  In cheerful homage to the rule of right,
    And lovest all, and renderest good for ill.

  For me, the sordid cares in which I dwell,
    Shrink and consume my heart, as heat the scroll;
  And wrath has left its scar--that fire of hell
    Has left its frightful scar upon my soul.

  Yet though thou wear'st the glory of the sky,
    Wilt thou not keep the same belovèd name,
  The same fair thoughtful brow, and gentle eye,
    Lovelier in heaven's sweet climate, yet the same?

","High thoughts!
    They come and go,
      Like the soft breathings of a listening maiden,
    While round me flow
      The winds, from woods and fields with gladness laden:
  When the corn's rustle on the ear doth come--
  When the eve's beetle sounds its drowsy hum--
  When the stars, dew-drops of the summer sky,
  Watch over all with soft and loving eye--
        While the leaves quiver
        By the lone river,
          And the quiet heart
            From depths doth call
            And garners all--

  When on the ear comes the soft song of bees--
  When every branch has its own favorite bird
  And songs of summer from each thicket heard!--
        Where the owl flitteth,
        Where the roe sitteth,
          And holiness
            Seems sleeping there;

      When I am resting on a mountain's bosom,
    And see below me strown

  When I can trace each streamlet through the meadow,
  When I can follow every fitful shadow--
  When I can watch the winds among the corn,
  And see the waves along the forest borne;
        Where blue-bell and heather
        Are blooming together,

  When weariness hath come upon the spirit--

    And sun and stars forevermore have set,
  The things o'er which our weak judgments here have spurned,
    The things o'er which we grieved with lashes wet,
  Will flash before us, out of life's dark night,
    As stars shine most in deeper tints of blue;
  And we shall see how all God's plans are right,
    And how what seems reproof was love most true.

  And we shall see how, while we frown and sigh,

  How, when we called, he heeded not our cry,

    Too much of sweet to craving babyhood,
  So God, perhaps, is keeping from us now

  Fever and fret and aimless stir
    And disappointed strife,
  All chafing, unsuccessful things,
    Make up the sum of life.

  Love adds anxiety to toil,
    And sameness doubles cares.
  While one unbroken chain of work
    The flagging temper wears.

  The light and air are dulled with smoke:
    The streets resound with noise;
  And the soul sinks to see its peers
    Chasing their joyless joys.

  Voices are round me; smiles are near;
    Kind welcomes to be had;
  And yet my spirit is alone,
    Fretful, outworn, and sad.

  A weary actor, I would fain
    Be quit of my long part;
  The burden of unquiet life
    Lies heavy on my heart.

  Wake up, and tears will wake with thee,

    Without or praise or prayer,
  Gives light to know, and life to do,
    And marvellous strength to bear.

JUVENAL,"
  The Spartan rogue who, boldly bent on fraud,
  Dared ask the god to sanction and applaud,
  And sought for counsel at the Pythian shrine,
  Received for answer from the lips divine,--
  ""That he who doubted to restore his trust,
  And reasoned much, reluctant to be just,
  Should for those doubts and that reluctance prove
  The deepest vengeance of the powers above.""
  The tale declares that not pronounced in vain
  Came forth the warning from the sacred fane:
  Ere long no branch of that devoted race
  Could mortal man on soil of Sparta trace!
  Thus but intended mischief, stayed in time,
  Had all the mortal guilt of finished crime.
    If such his fate who yet but darkly dares,
  Whose guilty purpose yet no act declares,
  What were it, done! Ah! now farewell to peace!
  Ne'er on this earth his soul's alarms shall cease!
  Held in the mouth that languid fever burns,
  His tasteless food he indolently turns;
  On Alba's oldest stock his soul shall pine!
  Forth from his lips he spits the joyless wine!
  Nor all the nectar of the hills shall now
  Or glad the heart, or smooth the wrinkled brow!
  While o'er the couch his aching limbs are cast,
  If care permit the brief repose at last,
  Lo! there the altar and the fane abused!
  Or darkly shadowed forth in dream confused,
  While the damp brow betrays the inward storm,
  Before him flits thy aggravated form!
  Then as new fears o'er all his senses press,
  Unwilling words the guilty truth confess!
  These, these be they whom secret terrors try.
  When muttered thunders shake the lurid sky;
  Whose deadly paleness now the gloom conceals
  And now the vivid flash anew reveals.
  No storm as Nature's casualty they hold.
  They deem without an aim no thunders rolled;
  Where'er the lightning strikes, the flash is thought
  Judicial fire, with Heaven's high vengeance fraught.
  Passes this by, with yet more anxious ear
  And greater dread, each future storm they fear;
  In burning vigil, deadliest foe to sleep,
  In their distempered frame if fever keep,
  Or the pained side their wonted rest prevent,
  Behold some incensed god his bow has bent!
  All pains, all aches, are stones and arrows hurled
  At bold offenders in this nether world!
  From them no crested cock acceptance meets!
  Their lamb before the altar vainly bleats!

"JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER.
"," The Rabbi Nathan, twoscore years and ten,
  Walked blameless through the evil world, and then
  Just as the almond blossomed in his hair,
  Met a temptation all too strong to bear,
  And miserably sinned. So, adding not
  Falsehood to guilt, he left his seat, and taught
  No more among the elders, but went out
  From the great congregation girt about
  With sackcloth, and with ashes on his head,
  Making his gray locks grayer. Long he prayed,
  Smiting his breast; then, as the Book he laid
  Open before him for the Bath-Col's choice,
  Pausing to hear that Daughter of a Voice,
  Behold the royal preacher's words: ""A friend
  Loveth at all times, yea, unto the end;
  And for the evil day thy brother lives.""
  Marvelling, he said: ""It is the Lord who gives
  Counsel in need. At Ecbatana dwells
  Rabbi Ben Isaac, who all men excels
  In righteousness and wisdom, as the trees
  Of Lebanon the small weeds that the bees
  Bow with their weight. I will arise and lay
  My sins before him.""

      And he went his way
  Barefooted, fasting long, with many prayers;
  But even as one who, followed unawares,
  Suddenly in the darkness feels a hand
  Thrill with its touch his own, and his cheek fanned
  By odors subtly sweet, and whispers near
  Of words he loathes, yet cannot choose but hear,
  So, while the Rabbi journeyed, chanting low
  The wail of David's penitential woe,
  Before him still the old temptation came,
  And mocked him with the motion and the shame
  Of such desires that, shuddering, he abhorred
  Himself; and, crying mightily to the Lord
  To free his soul and cast the demon out,
  Smote with his staff the blackness round about.

  At length, in the low light of a spent day,
  The towers of Ecbatana far away
  Rose on the desert's rim; and Nathan, faint
  And footsore, pausing where for some dead saint
  The faith of Islam reared a domèd tomb,
  Saw some one kneeling in the shadow, whom
  He greeted kindly: ""May the Holy One
  Answer thy prayers, O stranger!"" Whereupon
  The shape stood up with a loud cry, and then,
  Clasped in each other's arms, the two gray men
  Wept, praising him whose gracious providence
  Made their paths one. But straightway, as the sense
  Of his transgression smote him, Nathan tore
  Himself away: ""O friend beloved, no more
  Worthy am I to touch thee, for I came,
  Foul from my sins to tell thee all my shame.
  Haply thy prayers, since naught availeth mine,
  May purge my soul, and make it white like thine.
  Pity me, O Ben Isaac, I have sinned!""
  Awestruck Ben Isaac stood. The desert wind
  Blew his long mantle backward, laying bare
  The mournful secret of his shirt of hair.
  ""I too, O friend, if not in act,"" he said,
  ""In thought have verily sinned. Hast thou not read,
  'Better the eye should see than that desire
  Should wander'? Burning with a hidden fire
  That tears and prayers quench not, I come to thee
  For pity and for help, as thou to me.
  Pray for me, O my friend!"" But Nathan cried,
  ""Pray thou for me, Ben Isaac!""

      Side by side
  In the low sunshine by the turban stone
  They knelt; each made his brother's woe his own,
  Forgetting, in the agony and stress
  Of pitying love, his claim of selfishness;
  Peace, for his friend besought, his own became;
  His prayers were answered in another's name;
  And, when at last they rose up to embrace,
  Each saw God's pardon in his brother's face!

  Long after, when his headstone gathered moss,
  Traced on the targum-marge of Onkelos
  In Rabbi Nathan's hand these words were read:
  ""Hope not the cure of sin till Self is dead;
  Forget it in love's service, and the debt
  Thou canst not pay the angels shall forget;
  Heaven's gate is shut to him who comes alone;
  Save thou a soul, and it shall save thy own!""",TWO RABBIS.,Divine

    That had the Bible at my fingers' ends;
  That men might hear out of this mouth of mine
    How God doth make his enemies his friends;
  Rather than with a thundering and long prayer
  Be led into presumption, or despair.

  This would I be, and would none other be,
    But a religious servant of my God;
  And know there is none other God but he.
    And willingly to suffer mercy's rod,--
  Joy in his grace, and live but in his love,
  And seek my bliss but in the world above.

  And I would frame a kind of faithful prayer,
    For all estates within the state of grace,
  That careful love might never know despair.
    Nor servile fear might faithful love deface;
  And this would I both day and night devise
  To make my humble spirit's exercise.

  And I would read the rules of sacred life;
    Persuade the troubled soul to patience;
  The husband care, and comfort to the wife,
    To child and servant due obedience;
  Faith to the friend, and to the neighbor peace,
  That love might live, and quarrels all might cease.

  Prayer for the health of all that are diseased,
    Confession unto all that are convicted,
  And patience unto all that are displeased,
    And comfort unto all that are afflicted,
  And mercy unto all that have offended,
  And grace to all, that all may be amended.

  God of the thunder! from whose cloudy seat
    The fiery winds of Desolation flow;
  Father of vengeance, that with purple feet
    Like a full wine-press tread'st the world below;
  The embattled armies wait thy sign to slay,
  Nor springs the beast of havoc on his prey,
  Nor withering Famine walks his blasted way,
    Till thou hast marked the guilty land for woe.

  God of the rainbow! at whose gracious sign
    The billows of the proud their rage suppress;
  Father of mercies! at one word of thine
    An Eden blooms in the waste wilderness,
  And fountains sparkle in the arid sands,
  And timbrels ring in maidens' glancing hands,
  And marble cities crown the laughing lands,
    And pillared temples rise thy name to bless.

  O'er Judah's land thy thunders broke, O Lord!
    The chariots rattled o'er her sunken gate,
  Her sons were wasted by the Assyrian's sword,
    Even her foes wept to see her fallen state;
  And heaps her ivory palaces became,
  Her princes wore the captive's garb of shame,
  Her temples sank amid the smouldering flame,
    For thou didst ride the tempest cloud of fate.

  O'er Judah's land thy rainbow, Lord, shall beam,
    And the sad City lift her crownless head,
  And songs shall wake and dancing footsteps gleam
    In streets where broods the silence of the dead.
  The sun shall shine on Salem's gilded towers,
  On Carmel's side our maidens cull the flowers
  To deck at blushing eye their bridal bowers,
    And angel feet the glittering Sion tread.

  Thy vengeance gave us to the stranger's hand,
    And Abraham's children were led forth for slaves.
  With fettered steps we left our pleasant land,
    Envying our fathers in their peaceful graves.
  The strangers' bread with bitter tears we steep,
  And when our weary eyes should sink to sleep,
  In the mute midnight we steal forth to weep.
    Where the pale willows shade Euphrates' waves.

  The born in sorrow shall bring forth in joy;
    Thy mercy, Lord, shall lead thy children home;
  He that went forth a tender prattling boy
    Yet, ere he die, to Salem's streets shall come;
  And Canaan's vines for us their fruit shall bear,
  And Hermon's bees their honeyed stores prepare,
  And we shall kneel again in thankful prayer,

  O, it is hard to work for God,
    To rise and take his part
  Upon this battle-field of earth,
    And not sometimes lose heart!

  He hides himself so wondrously,
    As though there were no God;
  He is least seen when all the powers
    Of ill are most abroad.

  Or he deserts us at the hour
    The fight is all but lost;
  And seems to leave us to ourselves
    Just when we need him most.

  Ill masters good, good seems to change
    To ill with greater ease;
  And, worst of all, the good with good
    Is at cross-purposes.

  Ah! God is other than we think;
    His ways are far above,
  Far beyond reason's height, and reached
    Only by childlike love.

  Workman of God! O, lose not heart,
    But learn what God is like;
  And in the darkest battle-field
    Thou shalt know where to strike.

  Thrice blest is he to whom is given
    The instinct that can tell
  That God is on the field when he
    Is most invisible.

  Blest, is he who can divine
    Where the real right doth lie,
  And dares to take the side that seems
    Wrong to man's blindfold eye.

  His huge limbs to the accustomed toil:

    And never a bell is tolling:

  And feel our mother's smile press through
    The kisses she is giving.

  Between them, worse than either, we--
    Without the rest of glory!

    The murmur of the passions;
  And live alone, to live again
    With endless generations.
  Are we so brave?--The sea and sky
    In silence lift their mirrors;
  And, glassed therein, our spirits high
    Recoil from their own terrors.

  We sit on hills our childhood wist,
    Woods, hamlets, streams, beholding:

  The play is done,--the curtain drops,
    Slow falling to the prompter's bell;
  A moment yet the actor stops,
    And looks around, to say farewell.
  It is an irksome word and task;
    And, when he's laughed and said his say,
  He shows, as he removes the mask,
    A face that's anything but gay.

  One word, ere yet the evening ends,--
    Let's close it with a parting rhyme;
  And pledge a hand to all young friends,
    As flits the merry Christmas time;
  On life's wide scene you, too, have parts
    That fate erelong shall bid you play;
  Good night!--with honest, gentle hearts
    A kindly greeting go alway!

  Good night!--I'd say the griefs, the joys,
    Just hinted in this mimic page,
  The triumphs and defeats of boys,
    Are but repeated in our age;
  I'd say your woes were not less-keen,
    Your hopes more vain, than those of men,--
  Your pangs or pleasures of fifteen
    At forty-five played o'er again.

  I'd say we suffer and we strive
    Not less nor more as men than boys,--
  With grizzled beards at forty-five,
    As erst at twelve in corduroys;
  And if, in time of sacred youth,
    We learned at home to love and pray,
  Pray Heaven that early love and truth
    May never wholly pass away.

  And in the world, as in the school,
    I'd say how fate may change and shift,--
  The prize be sometimes with the fool,
    The race not always to the swift:
  The strong may yield, the good may fall,
    The great man be a vulgar clown,
  The knave be lifted over all,
    The kind cast pitilessly down.

  Who knows the inscrutable design?
    Blessed be Be who took and gave!
  Why should your mother, Charles, not mine,
    Be weeping at her darling's grave?
  We bow to Heaven that willed it so,
    That darkly rules the fate of all,
  That sends the respite or the blow,
    That's free to give or to recall.

  This crowns his feast with wine and wit,--
    Who brought him to that mirth and state?
  His betters, see, below him sit,
    Or hunger hopeless at the gate.
  Who bade the mud from Dives' wheel
    To spurn the rags of Lazarus?
  Come, brother, in that dust we'll kneel,
    Confessing Heaven that ruled it thus.

  So each shall mourn, in life's advance,
    Dear hopes, dear friends, untimely killed;
  Shall grieve for many a forfeit chance
    And longing passion unfulfilled.
  Amen!--whatever fate be sent,
    Pray God the heart may kindly glow,
  Although the head with cares be bent,
    And whitened with the winter snow.

  Come wealth or want, come good or ill,
    Let young and old accept their part,
  And bow before the awful will,
    And bear it with an honest heart.
  Who misses, or who wins the prize,--
    Go, lose or conquer as you can;
  But if you fail, or if you rise,
    Be each, pray God, a gentleman.

  A gentleman, or old or young!
    (Bear kindly with my humble lays;)

    Upon the first of Christmas days;
  The shepherds heard it overhead,--
    The joyful angels raised it then:
  Glory to Heaven on high, it said,
    And peace on earth to gentle men!

  My song, save this, is little worth;
    I lay the weary pen aside,
  And wish you health and love and mirth,
    As fits the solemn Christmas-tide.
  As fits the holy Christmas birth,

    Her tears were falling fast;
  ""Help, Lord,"" she cried, ""the shades of death
    Upon my soul are cast!
  Have I not shunned the path of sin,
    And chose the better part? ""--

    My wealth, O Lord?"" she cried;
  ""Have I kept aught of gems or gold,
    To minister to pride?
  Have I not bade youth's joys retire,
    And vain delights depart?""--
  But sad and tender was the voice,--
    _""My child, give me thy heart!""_

  ""Have I not, Lord, gone day by day
    Where thy poor children dwell;
  And carried help, and gold, and food?

  Have I not watched and wept?"" she cried;
    ""Did thy dear saints do more?
  Have I not gained thy grace, O Lord,
    And won in heaven my part?""--
  It echoed louder in her soul,--
    ""_My child, give me thy heart_!

  ""For I have loved thee with a love
    No mortal heart can show;
  A love so deep my saints in heaven
    Its depths can never know:
  When pierced and wounded on the cross,
    Man's sin and doom were mine,
  I loved thee with undying love,
    Immortal and divine!

  ""I loved thee ere the skies were spread;
    My soul bears all thy pains;
  To gain thy love my sacred heart
    In earthly shrines remains:
  Vain are thy offerings, vain thy sighs,
    Without one gift divine;
  Give it, my child, thy heart to me,
    And it shall rest in mine!""

  In awe she listened, as the shade
    Passed from her soul away;
  In low and trembling voice she cried,--
    ""Lord, help me to obey!
  Break thou the chains of earth, O Lord,
    That bind and hold my heart;
  Let it be thine and thine alone,
    Let none with thee have part.

  ""Send down, O Lord, thy sacred fire!
    Consume and cleanse the sin
  That lingers still within its depths:
    Let heavenly love begin.
  That sacred flame thy saints have known,

    Her angel by her side
  Knew that the hour of peace was come;

  May toss us into heaven again.

  White, black--queen, pawn,--'t is all the same,
  For on both sides he plays the game.

  Moved to and fro, from good to ill,
  We rise and fall as suits his will.""

  I know not, but thy guile I know;

  For how can I thy words believe,
  When even God thou didst deceive?

  A sea of lies art thou,--our sin
  Only a drop that sea within.""

  ""Not so,"" said Satan, ""I serve God,
  His angel now, and now his rod.

  In tempting I both bless and curse,
  Make good men better, bad men worse.

  You never tempt to good, but ill.

  Tell then the truth, for well I know
  You come as my most deadly foe.""

  Loud laughed the fiend. ""You know me well,
  Therefore my purpose I will tell.

  A swift repentance would ensue;

  And such repentance would have been

     Bird, breeze, and streamlet free;
     ""Our winter voices prophesy
     Of summer days to thee!""

     So, in those winters of the soul,
     By bitter blasts and drear
     O'erswept from Memory's frozen pole,
     Will sunny days appear.
     Reviving Hope and Faith, they show
     The soul its living powers,
     And how beneath the winter's snow
     Lie germs of summer flowers!

     The Night is mother of the Day,
     The Winter of the Spring,
     And ever upon old Decay
     The greenest mosses cling.
     Behind the cloud the starlight lurks,
     Through showers the sunbeams fall;
     For God, who loveth all His works,
     Has left His hope with all!",A DREAM OF SUMMER,Nature
,"The shadows round the inland sea
     Are deepening into night;
     Slow up the slopes of Ossipee
     They chase the lessening light.
     Tired of the long day's blinding heat,
     I rest my languid eye,
     Lake of the Hills! where, cool and sweet,
     Thy sunset waters lie!

     Along the sky, in wavy lines,
     O'er isle and reach and bay,
     Green-belted with eternal pines,
     The mountains stretch away.
     Below, the maple masses sleep
     Where shore with water blends,
     While midway on the tranquil deep
     The evening light descends.

     So seemed it when yon hill's red crown,
     Of old, the Indian trod,
     And, through the sunset air, looked down
     Upon the Smile of God.
     To him of light and shade the laws
     No forest skeptic taught;
     Their living and eternal Cause
     His truer instinct sought.

     He saw these mountains in the light
     Which now across them shines;
     This lake, in summer sunset bright,
     Walled round with sombering pines.
     God near him seemed; from earth and skies
     His loving voice he beard,
     As, face to face, in Paradise,
     Man stood before the Lord.

     Thanks, O our Father! that, like him,
     Thy tender love I see,
     In radiant hill and woodland dim,
     And tinted sunset sea.
     For not in mockery dost Thou fill
     Our earth with light and grace;
     Thou hid'st no dark and cruel will
     Behind Thy smiling face!","THE LAKESIDE

     Gone hath the Spring, with all its flowers,
     And gone the Summer's pomp and show,
     And Autumn, in his leafless bowers,
     Is waiting for the Winter's snow.

     I said to Earth, so cold and gray,
     ""An emblem of myself thou art.""
     ""Not so,"" the Earth did seem to say,
     ""For Spring shall warm my frozen heart.""
     I soothe my wintry sleep with dreams
     Of warmer sun and softer rain,
     And wait to hear the sound of streams
     And songs of merry birds again.

     But thou, from whom the Spring hath gone,
     For whom the flowers no longer blow,
     Who standest blighted and forlorn,
     Like Autumn waiting for the snow;

     No hope is thine of sunnier hours,
     Thy Winter shall no more depart;
     No Spring revive thy wasted flowers,
     Nor Summer warm thy frozen heart.
",AUTUMN THOUGHTS,Nature
," 'T is the noon of the spring-time, yet never a bird
     In the wind-shaken elm or the maple is heard;
     For green meadow-grasses wide levels of snow,
     And blowing of drifts where the crocus should blow;
     Where wind-flower and violet, amber and white,
     On south-sloping brooksides should smile in the light,
     O'er the cold winter-beds of their late-waking roots
     The frosty flake eddies, the ice-crystal shoots;
     And, longing for light, under wind-driven heaps,
     Round the boles of the pine-wood the ground-laurel creeps,
     Unkissed of the sunshine, unbaptized of showers,
     With buds scarcely swelled, which should burst into flowers
     We wait for thy coming, sweet wind of the south!
     For the touch of thy light wings, the kiss of thy mouth;
     For the yearly evangel thou bearest from God,
     Resurrection and life to the graves of the sod!
     Up our long river-valley, for days, have not ceased
     The wail and the shriek of the bitter northeast,
     Raw and chill, as if winnowed through ices and snow,
     All the way from the land of the wild Esquimau,
     Until all our dreams of the land of the blest,
     Like that red hunter's, turn to the sunny southwest.
     O soul of the spring-time, its light and its breath,
     Bring warmth to this coldness, bring life to this death;
     Renew the great miracle; let us behold
     The stone from the mouth of the sepulchre rolled,
     And Nature, like Lazarus, rise, as of old!
     Let our faith, which in darkness and coldness has lain,
     Revive with the warmth and the brightness again,
     And in blooming of flower and budding of tree
     The symbols and types of our destiny see;
     The life of the spring-time, the life of the whole,
     And, as sun to the sleeping earth, love to the soul!",APRIL.,Nature
," How strange to greet, this frosty morn,
     In graceful counterfeit of flowers,
     These children of the meadows, born
     Of sunshine and of showers!

     How well the conscious wood retains
     The pictures of its flower-sown home,
     The lights and shades, the purple stains,
     And golden hues of bloom!

     It was a happy thought to bring
     To the dark season's frost and rime
     This painted memory of spring,
     This dream of summer-time.

     Our hearts are lighter for its sake,
     Our fancy's age renews its youth,
     And dim-remembered fictions take
     The guise of--present truth.

     A wizard of the Merrimac,--
     So old ancestral legends say,
     Could call green leaf and blossom back
     To frosted stem and spray.

     The dry logs of the cottage wall,
     Beneath his touch, put out their leaves
     The clay-bound swallow, at his call,
     Played round the icy eaves.

     The settler saw his oaken flail
     Take bud, and bloom before his eyes;
     From frozen pools he saw the pale,
     Sweet summer lilies rise.

     To their old homes, by man profaned,
     Came the sad dryads, exiled long,
     And through their leafy tongues complained
     Of household use and wrong.

     The beechen platter sprouted wild,
     The pipkin wore its old-time green
     The cradle o'er the sleeping child
     Became a leafy screen.

     Haply our gentle friend hath met,
     While wandering in her sylvan quest,
     Haunting his native woodlands yet,
     That Druid of the West;

     And, while the dew on leaf and flower
     Glistened in moonlight clear and still,
     Learned the dusk wizard's spell of power,
     And caught his trick of skill.

     But welcome, be it new or old,
     The gift which makes the day more bright,
     And paints, upon the ground of cold
     And darkness, warmth and light.

     Without is neither gold nor green;
     Within, for birds, the birch-logs sing;
     Yet, summer-like, we sit between
     The autumn and the spring.

     The one, with bridal blush of rose,
     And sweetest breath of woodland balm,
     And one whose matron lips unclose
     In smiles of saintly calm.

     Fill soft and deep, O winter snow!
     The sweet azalea's oaken dells,
     And hide the bank where roses blow,
     And swing the azure bells!

     O'erlay the amber violet's leaves,
     The purple aster's brookside home,
     Guard all the flowers her pencil gives
     A life beyond their bloom.

     And she, when spring comes round again,
     By greening slope and singing flood
     Shall wander, seeking, not in vain,
     Her darlings of the wood.","FLOWERS IN WINTER

PAINTED UPON A PORTE LIVRE.
",Nature
,"The trailing arbutus, or mayflower, grows abundantly in the vicinity of
Plymouth, and was the first flower that greeted the Pilgrims after their
fearful winter. The name mayflower was familiar in England, as the
application of it to the historic vessel shows, but it was applied by
the English, and still is, to the hawthorn. Its use in New England in
connection with _Epigma repens _dates from a very early day, some
claiming that the first Pilgrims so used it, in affectionate memory of
the vessel and its English flower association.

     Sad Mayflower! watched by winter stars,
     And nursed by winter gales,
     With petals of the sleeted spars,
     And leaves of frozen sails!

     What had she in those dreary hours,
     Within her ice-rimmed bay,
     In common with the wild-wood flowers,
     The first sweet smiles of May?

     Yet, ""God be praised!"" the Pilgrim said,
     Who saw the blossoms peer
     Above the brown leaves, dry and dead,
     ""Behold our Mayflower here!""

     ""God wills it: here our rest shall be,
     Our years of wandering o'er;
     For us the Mayflower of the sea
     Shall spread her sails no more.""

     O sacred flowers of faith and hope,
     As sweetly now as then
     Ye bloom on many a birchen slope,
     In many a pine-dark glen.

     Behind the sea-wall's rugged length,
     Unchanged, your leaves unfold,
     Like love behind the manly strength
     Of the brave hearts of old.

     So live the fathers in their sons,
     Their sturdy faith be ours,
     And ours the love that overruns
     Its rocky strength with flowers!

     The Pilgrim's wild and wintry day
     Its shadow round us draws;
     The Mayflower of his stormy bay,
     Our Freedom's struggling cause.

     But warmer suns erelong shall bring
     To life the frozen sod;
     And through dead leaves of hope shall spring
     Afresh the flowers of God!",THE MAYFLOWERS,Nature

     I.
     O'er the bare woods, whose outstretched hands
     Plead with the leaden heavens in vain,
     I see, beyond the valley lands,
     The sea's long level dim with rain.
     Around me all things, stark and dumb,
     Seem praying for the snows to come,
     And, for the summer bloom and greenness gone,
     With winter's sunset lights and dazzling morn atone.

     II.
     Along the river's summer walk,
     The withered tufts of asters nod;
     And trembles on its arid stalk
     The boar plume of the golden-rod.
     And on a ground of sombre fir,
     And azure-studded juniper,
     The silver birch its buds of purple shows,
     And scarlet berries tell where bloomed the sweet wild-rose!

     III.
     With mingled sound of horns and bells,
     A far-heard clang, the wild geese fly,
     Storm-sent, from Arctic moors and fells,
     Like a great arrow through the sky,
     Two dusky lines converged in one,
     Chasing the southward-flying sun;
     While the brave snow-bird and the hardy jay
     Call to them from the pines, as if to bid them stay.

     IV.
     I passed this way a year ago
     The wind blew south; the noon of day
     Was warm as June's; and save that snow
     Flecked the low mountains far away,
     And that the vernal-seeming breeze
     Mocked faded grass and leafless trees,
     I might have dreamed of summer as I lay,
     Watching the fallen leaves with the soft wind at play.

     V.
     Since then, the winter blasts have piled
     The white pagodas of the snow
     On these rough slopes, and, strong and wild,
     Yon river, in its overflow
     Of spring-time rain and sun, set free,
     Crashed with its ices to the sea;
     And over these gray fields, then green and gold,
     The summer corn has waved, the thunder's organ rolled.

     VI.
     Rich gift of God! A year of time
     What pomp of rise and shut of day,
     What hues wherewith our Northern clime
     Makes autumn's dropping woodlands gay,
     What airs outblown from ferny dells,
     And clover-bloom and sweetbrier smells,
     What songs of brooks and birds, what fruits and flowers,
     Green woods and moonlit snows, have in its round been ours!

     VII.
     I know not how, in other lands,
     The changing seasons come and go;
     What splendors fall on Syrian sands,
     What purple lights on Alpine snow!
     Nor how the pomp of sunrise waits
     On Venice at her watery gates;
     A dream alone to me is Arno's vale,
     And the Alhambra's halls are but a traveller's tale.

     VIII.
     Yet, on life's current, he who drifts
     Is one with him who rows or sails
     And he who wanders widest lifts
     No more of beauty's jealous veils
     Than he who from his doorway sees
     The miracle of flowers and trees,
     Feels the warm Orient in the noonday air,
     And from cloud minarets hears the sunset call to prayer!

     IX.
     The eye may well be glad that looks
     Where Pharpar's fountains rise and fall;
     But he who sees his native brooks
     Laugh in the sun, has seen them all.
     The marble palaces of Ind
     Rise round him in the snow and wind;
     From his lone sweetbrier Persian Hafiz smiles,
     And Rome's cathedral awe is in his woodland aisles.

     X.
     And thus it is my fancy blends
     The near at hand and far and rare;
     And while the same horizon bends
     Above the silver-sprinkled hair
     Which flashed the light of morning skies
     On childhood's wonder-lifted eyes,
     Within its round of sea and sky and field,
     Earth wheels with all her zones, the Kosmos stands revealed.

     XI.
     And thus the sick man on his bed,
     The toiler to his task-work bound,
     Behold their prison-walls outspread,
     Their clipped horizon widen round!
     While freedom-giving fancy waits,
     Like Peter's angel at the gates,
     The power is theirs to baffle care and pain,
     To bring the lost world back, and make it theirs again!

     XII.
     What lack of goodly company,
     When masters of the ancient lyre
     Obey my call, and trace for me
     Their words of mingled tears and fire!
     I talk with Bacon, grave and wise,
     I read the world with Pascal's eyes;
     And priest and sage, with solemn brows austere,
     And poets, garland-bound, the Lords of Thought, draw near.

     XIII.
     Methinks, O friend, I hear thee say,
        ""In vain the human heart we mock;
     Bring living guests who love the day,
     Not ghosts who fly at crow of cock!
     The herbs we share with flesh and blood
     Are better than ambrosial food
     With laurelled shades."" I grant it, nothing loath,
     But doubly blest is he who can partake of both.

     XIV.
     He who might Plato's banquet grace,
     Have I not seen before me sit,
     And watched his puritanic face,
     With more than Eastern wisdom lit?
     Shrewd mystic! who, upon the back
     Of his Poor Richard's Almanac,
     Writing the Sufi's song, the Gentoo's dream,
     Links Manu's age of thought to Fulton's age of steam!

     XV.
     Here too, of answering love secure,
     Have I not welcomed to my hearth
     The gentle pilgrim troubadour,
     Whose songs have girdled half the earth;
     Whose pages, like the magic mat
     Whereon the Eastern lover sat,
     Have borne me over Rhine-land's purple vines,
     And Nubia's tawny sands, and Phrygia's mountain pines!

     XVI.
     And he, who to the lettered wealth
     Of ages adds the lore unpriced,
     The wisdom and the moral health,
     The ethics of the school of Christ;
     The statesman to his holy trust,
     As the Athenian archon, just,
     Struck down, exiled like him for truth alone,
     Has he not graced my home with beauty all his own?

     XVII.
     What greetings smile, what farewells wave,
     What loved ones enter and depart!
     The good, the beautiful, the brave,
     The Heaven-lent treasures of the heart!
     How conscious seems the frozen sod
     And beechen slope whereon they trod
     The oak-leaves rustle, and the dry grass bends
     Beneath the shadowy feet of lost or absent friends.

     XVIII.
     Then ask not why to these bleak hills
     I cling, as clings the tufted moss,
     To bear the winter's lingering chills,
     The mocking spring's perpetual loss.
     I dream of lands where summer smiles,
     And soft winds blow from spicy isles,
     But scarce would Ceylon's breath of flowers be sweet,
     Could I not feel thy soil, New England, at my feet!

     XIX.
     At times I long for gentler skies,
     And bathe in dreams of softer air,
     But homesick tears would fill the eyes
     That saw the Cross without the Bear.
     The pine must whisper to the palm,
     The north-wind break the tropic calm;
     And with the dreamy languor of the Line,
     The North's keen virtue blend, and strength to beauty join.

     XX.
     Better to stem with heart and hand
     The roaring tide of life, than lie,
     Unmindful, on its flowery strand,
     Of God's occasions drifting by
     Better with naked nerve to bear
     The needles of this goading air,
     Than, in the lap of sensual ease, forego
     The godlike power to do, the godlike aim to know.

     XXI.
     Home of my heart! to me more fair
     Than gay Versailles or Windsor's halls,
     The painted, shingly town-house where
     The freeman's vote for Freedom falls!
     The simple roof where prayer is made,
     Than Gothic groin and colonnade;
     The living temple of the heart of man,
     Than Rome's sky-mocking vault, or many-spired Milan!

     XXII.
     More dear thy equal village schools,
     Where rich and poor the Bible read,
     Than classic halls where Priestcraft rules,
     And Learning wears the chains of Creed;
     Thy glad Thanksgiving, gathering in
     The scattered sheaves of home and kin,
     Than the mad license ushering Lenten pains,
     Or holidays of slaves who laugh and dance in chains.

     XXIII.
     And sweet homes nestle in these dales,
     And perch along these wooded swells;
     And, blest beyond Arcadian vales,
     They hear the sound of Sabbath bells!
     Here dwells no perfect man sublime,
     Nor woman winged before her time,
     But with the faults and follies of the race,
     Old home-bred virtues hold their not unhonored place.

     XXIV.
     Here manhood struggles for the sake
     Of mother, sister, daughter, wife,
     The graces and the loves which make
     The music of the march of life;
     And woman, in her daily round
     Of duty, walks on holy ground.
     No unpaid menial tills the soil, nor here
     Is the bad lesson learned at human rights to sneer.

     XXV.
     Then let the icy north-wind blow
     The trumpets of the coming storm,
     To arrowy sleet and blinding snow
     Yon slanting lines of rain transform.
     Young hearts shall hail the drifted cold,
     As gayly as I did of old;
     And I, who watch them through the frosty pane,
     Unenvious, live in them my boyhood o'er again.

     XXVI.
     And I will trust that He who heeds
     The life that hides in mead and wold,
     Who hangs yon alder's crimson beads,
     And stains these mosses green and gold,
     Will still, as He hath done, incline
     His gracious care to me and mine;
     Grant what we ask aright, from wrong debar,
     And, as the earth grows dark, make brighter every star!

     XXVII.
     I have not seen, I may not see,
     My hopes for man take form in fact,
     But God will give the victory
     In due time; in that faith I act.
     And lie who sees the future sure,
     The baffling present may endure,
     And bless, meanwhile, the unseen Hand that leads
     The heart's desires beyond the halting step of deeds.

     XXVIII.
     And thou, my song, I send thee forth,
     Where harsher songs of mine have flown;
     Go, find a place at home and hearth
     Where'er thy singer's name is known;
     Revive for him the kindly thought
     Of friends; and they who love him not,
     Touched by some strain of thine, perchance may take
     The hand he proffers all, and thank him for thy sake.
",THE LAST WALK IN AUTUMN.,Nature
,"For ages on our river borders,
     These tassels in their tawny bloom,
     And willowy studs of downy silver,
     Have prophesied of Spring to come.

     For ages have the unbound waters
     Smiled on them from their pebbly hem,
     And the clear carol of the robin
     And song of bluebird welcomed them.

     But never yet from smiling river,
     Or song of early bird, have they
     Been greeted with a gladder welcome
     Than whispers from my heart to-day.

     They break the spell of cold and darkness,
     The weary watch of sleepless pain;
     And from my heart, as from the river,
     The ice of winter melts again.

     Thanks, Mary! for this wild-wood token
     Of Freya's footsteps drawing near;
     Almost, as in the rune of Asgard,
     The growing of the grass I hear.

     It is as if the pine-trees called me
     From ceiled room and silent books,
     To see the dance of woodland shadows,
     And hear the song of April brooks!

     As in the old Teutonic ballad
     Of Odenwald live bird and tree,
     Together live in bloom and music,
     I blend in song thy flowers and thee.

     Earth's rocky tablets bear forever
     The dint of rain and small bird's track
     Who knows but that my idle verses
     May leave some trace by Merrimac!

     The bird that trod the mellow layers
     Of the young earth is sought in vain;
     The cloud is gone that wove the sandstone,
     From God's design, with threads of rain!

     So, when this fluid age we live in
     Shall stiffen round my careless rhyme,
     Who made the vagrant tracks may puzzle
     The savants of the coming time;

     And, following out their dim suggestions,
     Some idly-curious hand may draw
     My doubtful portraiture, as Cuvier
     Drew fish and bird from fin and claw.

     And maidens in the far-off twilights,
     Singing my words to breeze and stream,
     Shall wonder if the old-time Mary
     Were real, or the rhymer's dream!",THE FIRST FLOWERS,Nature
,"Our vales are sweet with fern and rose,
     Our hills are maple-crowned;
     But not from them our fathers chose
     The village burying-ground.

     The dreariest spot in all the land
     To Death they set apart;
     With scanty grace from Nature's hand,
     And none from that of Art.

     A winding wall of mossy stone,
     Frost-flung and broken, lines
     A lonesome acre thinly grown
     With grass and wandering vines.

     Without the wall a birch-tree shows
     Its drooped and tasselled head;
     Within, a stag-horned sumach grows,
     Fern-leafed, with spikes of red.

     There, sheep that graze the neighboring plain
     Like white ghosts come and go,
     The farm-horse drags his fetlock chain,
     The cow-bell tinkles slow.

     Low moans the river from its bed,
     The distant pines reply;
     Like mourners shrinking from the dead,
     They stand apart and sigh.

     Unshaded smites the summer sun,
     Unchecked the winter blast;
     The school-girl learns the place to shun,
     With glances backward cast.

     For thus our fathers testified,
     That he might read who ran,
     The emptiness of human pride,
     The nothingness of man.

     They dared not plant the grave with flowers,
     Nor dress the funeral sod,
     Where, with a love as deep as ours,
     They left their dead with God.

     The hard and thorny path they kept
     From beauty turned aside;
     Nor missed they over those who slept
     The grace to life denied.

     Yet still the wilding flowers would blow,
     The golden leaves would fall,
     The seasons come, the seasons go,
     And God be good to all.

     Above the graves the' blackberry hung
     In bloom and green its wreath,
     And harebells swung as if they rung
     The chimes of peace beneath.

     The beauty Nature loves to share,
     The gifts she hath for all,
     The common light, the common air,
     O'ercrept the graveyard's wall.

     It knew the glow of eventide,
     The sunrise and the noon,
     And glorified and sanctified
     It slept beneath the moon.

     With flowers or snow-flakes for its sod,
     Around the seasons ran,
     And evermore the love of God
     Rebuked the fear of man.

     We dwell with fears on either hand,
     Within a daily strife,
     And spectral problems waiting stand
     Before the gates of life.

     The doubts we vainly seek to solve,
     The truths we know, are one;
     The known and nameless stars revolve
     Around the Central Sun.

     And if we reap as we have sown,
     And take the dole we deal,
     The law of pain is love alone,
     The wounding is to heal.

     Unharmed from change to change we glide,
     We fall as in our dreams;
     The far-off terror at our side
     A smiling angel seems.

     Secure on God's all-tender heart
     Alike rest great and small;
     Why fear to lose our little part,
     When He is pledged for all?

     O fearful heart and troubled brain
     Take hope and strength from this,--
     That Nature never hints in vain,
     Nor prophesies amiss.

     Her wild birds sing the same sweet stave,
     Her lights and airs are given
     Alike to playground and the grave;
     And over both is Heaven.
",THE OLD BURYING-GROUND.,Nature
,"No bird-song floated down the hill,
     The tangled bank below was still;

     No rustle from the birchen stem,
     No ripple from the water's hem.

     The dusk of twilight round us grew,
     We felt the falling of the dew;

     For, from us, ere the day was done,
     The wooded hills shut out the sun.

     But on the river's farther side
     We saw the hill-tops glorified,--

     A tender glow, exceeding fair,
     A dream of day without its glare.

     With us the damp, the chill, the gloom
     With them the sunset's rosy bloom;

     While dark, through willowy vistas seen,
     The river rolled in shade between.

     From out the darkness where we trod,
     We gazed upon those bills of God,

     Whose light seemed not of moon or sun.
     We spake not, but our thought was one.

     We paused, as if from that bright shore
     Beckoned our dear ones gone before;

     And stilled our beating hearts to hear
     The voices lost to mortal ear!

     Sudden our pathway turned from night;
     The hills swung open to the light;

     Through their green gates the sunshine showed,
     A long, slant splendor downward flowed.

     Down glade and glen and bank it rolled;
     It bridged the shaded stream with gold;

     And, borne on piers of mist, allied
     The shadowy with the sunlit side!

     ""So,"" prayed we, ""when our feet draw near
     The river dark, with mortal fear,

     ""And the night cometh chill with dew,
     O Father! let Thy light break through!

     ""So let the hills of doubt divide,
     So bridge with faith the sunless tide!

     ""So let the eyes that fail on earth
     On Thy eternal hills look forth;

     ""And in Thy beckoning angels know
     The dear ones whom we loved below!""

     In the simple Indian lore
     Still to me the legend seems
     Of the shapes who flit before.

     Flitting, passing, seen and gone,
     Never reached nor found at rest,
     Baffling search, but beckoning on
     To the Sunset of the Blest.

     From the clefts of mountain rocks,
     Through the dark of lowland firs,
     Flash the eyes and flow the locks
     Of the mystic Vanishers!

     And the fisher in his skiff,
     And the hunter on the moss,
     Hear their call from cape and cliff,
     See their hands the birch-leaves toss.

     Wistful, longing, through the green
     Twilight of the clustered pines,
     In their faces rarely seen
     Beauty more than mortal shines.

     Fringed with gold their mantles flow
     On the slopes of westering knolls;
     In the wind they whisper low
     Of the Sunset Land of Souls.

     Doubt who may, O friend of mine!
     Thou and I have seen them too;
     On before with beck and sign
     Still they glide, and we pursue.

     More than clouds of purple trail
     In the gold of setting day;
     More than gleams of wing or sail
     Beckon from the sea-mist gray.

     Glimpses of immortal youth,
     Gleams and glories seen and flown,
     Far-heard voices sweet with truth,
     Airs from viewless Eden blown;

     Beauty that eludes our grasp,
     Sweetness that transcends our taste,
     Loving hands we may not clasp,
     Shining feet that mock our haste;

     Gentle eyes we closed below,
     Tender voices heard once more,
     Smile and call us, as they go
     On and onward, still before.

     Guided thus, O friend of mine
     Let us walk our little way,
     Knowing by each beckoning sign
     That we are not quite astray.

,"A sound as if from bells of silver,
     Or elfin cymbals smitten clear,
     Through the frost-pictured panes I hear.

     A brightness which outshines the morning,
     A splendor brooking no delay,
     Beckons and tempts my feet away.

     I leave the trodden village highway
     For virgin snow-paths glimmering through
     A jewelled elm-tree avenue;

     Where, keen against the walls of sapphire,
     The gleaming tree-bolls, ice-embossed,
     Hold up their chandeliers of frost.

     I tread in Orient halls enchanted,
     I dream the Saga's dream of caves
     Gem-lit beneath the North Sea waves!

     I walk the land of Eldorado,
     I touch its mimic garden bowers,
     Its silver leaves and diamond flowers!

     The flora of the mystic mine-world
     Around me lifts on crystal stems
     The petals of its clustered gems!

     What miracle of weird transforming
     In this wild work of frost and light,
     This glimpse of glory infinite!

     This foregleam of the Holy City
     Like that to him of Patmos given,
     The white bride coming down from heaven!

     How flash the ranked and mail-clad alders,
     Through what sharp-glancing spears of reeds
     The brook its muffled water leads!

     Yon maple, like the bush of Horeb,
     Burns unconsumed: a white, cold fire
     Rays out from every grassy spire.

     Each slender rush and spike of mullein,
     Low laurel shrub and drooping fern,
     Transfigured, blaze where'er I turn.

     How yonder Ethiopian hemlock
     Crowned with his glistening circlet stands!
     What jewels light his swarthy hands!

     Here, where the forest opens southward,
     Between its hospitable pines,
     As through a door, the warm sun shines.

     The jewels loosen on the branches,
     And lightly, as the soft winds blow,
     Fall, tinkling, on the ice below.

     And through the clashing of their cymbals
     I hear the old familiar fall
     Of water down the rocky wall,

     Where, from its wintry prison breaking,
     In dark and silence hidden long,
     The brook repeats its summer song.

     One instant flashing in the sunshine,
     Keen as a sabre from its sheath,
     Then lost again the ice beneath.

     I hear the rabbit lightly leaping,
     The foolish screaming of the jay,
     The chopper's axe-stroke far away;

     The clamor of some neighboring barn-yard,
     The lazy cock's belated crow,
     Or cattle-tramp in crispy snow.

     And, as in some enchanted forest
     The lost knight hears his comrades sing,
     And, near at hand, their bridles ring,--

     So welcome I these sounds and voices,
     These airs from far-off summer blown,
     This life that leaves me not alone.

     For the white glory overawes me;
     The crystal terror of the seer
     Of Chebar's vision blinds me here.

     Rebuke me not, O sapphire heaven!
     Thou stainless earth, lay not on me,
     Thy keen reproach of purity,

     If, in this August presence-chamber,
     I sigh for summer's leaf-green gloom
     And warm airs thick with odorous bloom!

     Let the strange frost-work sink and crumble,
     And let the loosened tree-boughs swing,
     Till all their bells of silver ring.

     Shine warmly down, thou sun of noontime,
     On this chill pageant, melt and move
     The winter's frozen heart with love.

     And, soft and low, thou wind south-blowing,
     Breathe through a veil of tenderest haze
     Thy prophecy of summer days.

     Come with thy green relief of promise,
     And to this dead, cold splendor bring

,"The time of gifts has come again,
     And, on my northern window-pane,
     Outlined against the day's brief light,
     A Christmas token hangs in sight.

     The wayside travellers, as they pass,
     Mark the gray disk of clouded glass;
     And the dull blankness seems, perchance,
     Folly to their wise ignorance.

     They cannot from their outlook see
     The perfect grace it hath for me;
     For there the flower, whose fringes through
     The frosty breath of autumn blew,
     Turns from without its face of bloom
     To the warm tropic of my room,
     As fair as when beside its brook
     The hue of bending skies it took.

     So from the trodden ways of earth,
     Seem some sweet souls who veil their worth,
     And offer to the careless glance
     The clouding gray of circumstance.
     They blossom best where hearth-fires burn,
     To loving eyes alone they turn
     The flowers of inward grace, that hide
     Their beauty from the world outside.

     But deeper meanings come to me,
     My half-immortal flower, from thee!
     Man judges from a partial view,
     None ever yet his brother knew;

,"The river hemmed with leaning trees
     Wound through its meadows green;
     A low, blue line of mountains showed
     The open pines between.

     One sharp, tall peak above them all
     Clear into sunlight sprang
     I saw the river of my dreams,
     The mountains that I sang!

     No clue of memory led me on,
     But well the ways I knew;
     A feeling of familiar things
     With every footstep grew.

     Not otherwise above its crag
     Could lean the blasted pine;
     Not otherwise the maple hold
     Aloft its red ensign.

     So up the long and shorn foot-hills
     The mountain road should creep;
     So, green and low, the meadow fold
     Its red-haired kine asleep.

     The river wound as it should wind;
     Their place the mountains took;
     The white torn fringes of their clouds
     Wore no unwonted look.

     Yet ne'er before that river's rim
     Was pressed by feet of mine,
     Never before mine eyes had crossed
     That broken mountain line.

     A presence, strange at once and known,
     Walked with me as my guide;
     The skirts of some forgotten life
     Trailed noiseless at my side.

     Was it a dim-remembered dream?
     Or glimpse through aeons old?
     The secret which the mountains kept
     The river never told.

     But from the vision ere it passed
     A tender hope I drew,
     And, pleasant as a dawn of spring,
     The thought within me grew,

     That love would temper every change,
     And soften all surprise,
     And, misty with the dreams of earth,
     The hills of Heaven arise.

",Nature
,"We saw the slow tides go and come,
     The curving surf-lines lightly drawn,
     The gray rocks touched with tender bloom
     Beneath the fresh-blown rose of dawn.

     We saw in richer sunsets lost
     The sombre pomp of showery noons;
     And signalled spectral sails that crossed
     The weird, low light of rising moons.

     On stormy eves from cliff and head
     We saw the white spray tossed and spurned;
     While over all, in gold and red,
     Its face of fire the lighthouse turned.

     The rail-car brought its daily crowds,
     Half curious, half indifferent,
     Like passing sails or floating clouds,
     We saw them as they came and went.

     But, one calm morning, as we lay
     And watched the mirage-lifted wall
     Of coast, across the dreamy bay,
     And heard afar the curlew call,

     And nearer voices, wild or tame,
     Of airy flock and childish throng,
     Up from the water's edge there came
     Faint snatches of familiar song.

     Careless we heard the singer's choice
     Of old and common airs; at last
     The tender pathos of his voice
     In one low chanson held us fast.

     A song that mingled joy and pain,
     And memories old and sadly sweet;
     While, timing to its minor strain,
     The waves in lapsing cadence beat.

            .     .     .     .     .

     The waves are glad in breeze and sun;
     The rocks are fringed with foam;
     I walk once more a haunted shore,
     A stranger, yet at home,
     A land of dreams I roam.

     Is this the wind, the soft sea wind
     That stirred thy locks of brown?
     Are these the rocks whose mosses knew
     The trail of thy light gown,
     Where boy and girl sat down?

     I see the gray fort's broken wall,
     The boats that rock below;
     And, out at sea, the passing sails
     We saw so long ago
     Rose-red in morning's glow.

     The freshness of the early time
     On every breeze is blown;
     As glad the sea, as blue the sky,--
     The change is ours alone;
     The saddest is my own.

     A stranger now, a world-worn man,
     Is he who bears my name;
     But thou, methinks, whose mortal life
     Immortal youth became,
     Art evermore the same.

     Thou art not here, thou art not there,
     Thy place I cannot see;
     I only know that where thou art
     The blessed angels be,
     And heaven is glad for thee.

     Forgive me if the evil years
     Have left on me their sign;
     Wash out, O soul so beautiful,
     The many stains of mine
     In tears of love divine!

     I could not look on thee and live,
     If thou wert by my side;
     The vision of a shining one,
     The white and heavenly bride,
     Is well to me denied.

     But turn to me thy dear girl-face
     Without the angel's crown,
     The wedded roses of thy lips,
     Thy loose hair rippling down
     In waves of golden brown.

     Look forth once more through space and time,
     And let thy sweet shade fall
     In tenderest grace of soul and form
     On memory's frescoed wall,
     A shadow, and yet all!

     Draw near, more near, forever dear!
     Where'er I rest or roam,
     Or in the city's crowded streets,
     Or by the blown sea foam,
     The thought of thee is home!

     At breakfast hour the singer read
     The city news, with comment wise,
     Like one who felt the pulse of trade
     Beneath his finger fall and rise.

     His look, his air, his curt speech, told
     The man of action, not of books,
     To whom the corners made in gold
     And stocks were more than seaside nooks.

     Of life beneath the life confessed
     His song had hinted unawares;
     Of flowers in traffic's ledgers pressed,
     Of human hearts in bulls and bears.

     But eyes in vain were turned to watch
     That face so hard and shrewd and strong;
     And ears in vain grew sharp to catch
     The meaning of that morning song.

     In vain some sweet-voiced querist sought
     To sound him, leaving as she came;
     Her baited album only caught
     A common, unromantic name.

     No word betrayed the mystery fine,
     That trembled on the singer's tongue;
     He came and went, and left no sign
     Behind him save the song he sung.",A SEA DREAM.,Nature

     No pale, belated flowers recall
     The astral fringes of the rills,
     And drearily the dead vines fall,
     Frost-blackened, from the roadside wall.

     Yet through the gray and sombre wood,
     Against the dusk of fir and pine,
     Last of their floral sisterhood,

     Small beauty hath my unsung flower,
     For spring to own or summer hail;

     To skies that weep and winds that wail
     Its glad surprisals never fail.

     O days grown cold! O life grown old
     No rose of June may bloom again;
     But, like the hazel's twisted gold,
     Through early frost and latter rain
     Shall hints of summer-time remain.

     And as within the hazel's bough
     A gift of mystic virtue dwells,
     That points to golden ores below,
     And in dry desert places tells
     Where flow unseen the cool, sweet wells,

     So, in the wise Diviner's hand,
     Be mine the hazel's grateful part
     To feel, beneath a thirsty land,
     The living waters thrill and start,
     The beating of the rivulet's heart!

     Sufficeth me the gift to light
     With latest bloom the dark, cold days;
     To call some hidden spring to sight
     That, in these dry and dusty ways,
     Shall sing its pleasant song of praise.

     O Love! the hazel-wand may fail,
     But thou canst lend the surer spell,
     That, passing over Baca's vale,
     Repeats the old-time miracle,
     And makes the desert-land a well.

     Of hills the river runs,
     As down its long, green valley falls
     The last of summer's suns.

     Along its tawny gravel-bed
     Broad-flowing, swift, and still,
     As if its meadow levels felt
     The hurry of the hill,
     Noiseless between its banks of green
     From curve to curve it slips;
     The drowsy maple-shadows rest

     By Spenser's Mulla grew;
     And through the gaps of leaning trees
     Its mountain cradle shows
     The gold against the amethyst,

     Touched by a light that hath no name,
     A glory never sung,
     Aloft on sky and mountain wall

     How changed the summits vast and old!
     No longer granite-browed,
     They melt in rosy mist; the rock
     Is softer than the cloud;
     The valley holds its breath; no leaf
     Of all its elms is twirled
     The silence of eternity
     Seems falling on the world.

     The pause before the breaking seals
     Of mystery is this;
     Yon miracle-play of night and day
     Makes dumb its witnesses.
     What unseen altar crowns the hills
     That reach up stair on stair?
     What eyes look through, what white wings fan
     These purple veils of air?
     What Presence from the heavenly heights
     To those of earth stoops down?
     Not vainly Hellas dreamed of gods
     On Ida's snowy crown!

     Slow fades the vision of the sky,
     The golden water pales,

     I go the common way of all;
     The sunset fires will burn,
     The flowers will blow, the river flow,
     When I no more return.
     No whisper from the mountain pine
     Nor lapsing stream shall tell
     The stranger, treading where I tread,
     Of him who loved them well.

     But beauty seen is never lost,
     God's colors all are fast;
     The glory of this sunset heaven
     Into my soul has passed,
     A sense of gladness unconfined
     To mortal date or clime;
     As the soul liveth, it shall live
     Beyond the years of time.
     Beside the mystic asphodels
     Shall bloom the home-born flowers,
     And new horizons flush and glow
     With sunset hues of ours.

     Farewell! these smiling hills must wear
     Too soon their wintry frown,
     And snow-cold winds from off them shake
     The maple's red leaves down.
     But I shall see a summer sun
     Still setting broad and low;
     The mountain slopes shall blush and bloom,
     The golden water flow.
     A lover's claim is mine on all
     I see to have and hold,--
     The rose-light of perpetual hills,
     And sunsets never cold!

,"I wandered lonely where the pine-trees made
     Against the bitter East their barricade,
     And, guided by its sweet
     Perfume, I found, within a narrow dell,
     The trailing spring flower tinted like a shell
     Amid dry leaves and mosses at my feet.

     From under dead boughs, for whose loss the pines
     Moaned ceaseless overhead, the blossoming vines
     Lifted their glad surprise,
     While yet the bluebird smoothed in leafless trees
     His feathers ruffled by the chill sea-breeze,
     And snow-drifts lingered under April skies.

     As, pausing, o'er the lonely flower I bent,
     I thought of lives thus lowly, clogged and pent,
     Which yet find room,
     Through care and cumber, coldness and decay,
     To lend a sweetness to the ungenial day
     And make the sad earth happier for their bloom.",THE TRAILING ARBUTUS,Nature

     O gracious morn, with rose-red dawn,
     And thin moon curving o'er it!
     The old year's darling, latest born,
     More loved than all before it!

     How flamed the sunrise through the pines!
     How stretched the birchen shadows,
     Braiding in long, wind-wavered lines
     The westward sloping meadows!

     The sweet day, opening as a flower
     Unfolds its petals tender,
     Renews for us at noontide's hour
     The summer's tempered splendor.

     The birds are hushed; alone the wind,
     That through the woodland searches,
     The red-oak's lingering leaves can find,
     And yellow plumes of larches.

     But still the balsam-breathing pine
     Invites no thought of sorrow,
     No hint of loss from air like wine
     The earth's content can borrow.

     The summer and the winter here
     Midway a truce are holding,
     A soft, consenting atmosphere
     Their tents of peace enfolding.

     The silent woods, the lonely hills,
     Rise solemn in their gladness;
     The quiet that the valley fills
     Is scarcely joy or sadness.

     How strange! The autumn yesterday
     In winter's grasp seemed dying;
     On whirling winds from skies of gray
     The early snow was flying.

     And now, while over Nature's mood
     There steals a soft relenting,
     I will not mar the present good,
     Forecasting or lamenting.

     My autumn time and Nature's hold
     A dreamy tryst together,
     And, both grown old, about us fold
     The golden-tissued weather.

     I lean my heart against the day
     To feel its bland caressing;
     I will not let it pass away
     Before it leaves its blessing.

     God's angels come not as of old
     The Syrian shepherds knew them;
     In reddening dawns, in sunset gold,
     And warm noon lights I view them.

     Nor need there is, in times like this
     When heaven to earth draws nearer,
     Of wing or song as witnesses
     To make their presence clearer.

     O stream of life, whose swifter flow
     Is of the end forewarning,
     Methinks thy sundown afterglow
     Seems less of night than morning!

     Old cares grow light; aside I lay
     The doubts and fears that troubled;
     The quiet of the happy day
     Within my soul is doubled.

     That clouds must veil this fair sunshine
     Not less a joy I find it;
     Nor less yon warm horizon line
     That winter lurks behind it.

     The mystery of the untried days
     I close my eyes from reading;
     His will be done whose darkest ways
     To light and life are leading!

     Less drear the winter night shall be,
     If memory cheer and hearten
     Its heavy hours with thoughts of thee,
     Sweet summer of St. Martin!",ST. MARTIN'S SUMMER.,Nature
,"To kneel before some saintly shrine,
     To breathe the health of airs divine,
     Or bathe where sacred rivers flow,
     The cowled and turbaned pilgrims go.
     I too, a palmer, take, as they
     With staff and scallop-shell, my way
     To feel, from burdening cares and ills,
     The strong uplifting of the hills.

     The years are many since, at first,
     For dreamed-of wonders all athirst,
     I saw on Winnipesaukee fall
     The shadow of the mountain wall.
     Ah! where are they who sailed with me
     The beautiful island-studded sea?
     And am I he whose keen surprise
     Flashed out from such unclouded eyes?

     Still, when the sun of summer burns,
     My longing for the hills returns;
     And northward, leaving at my back
     The warm vale of the Merrimac,
     I go to meet the winds of morn,
     Blown down the hill-gaps, mountain-born,
     Breathe scent of pines, and satisfy
     The hunger of a lowland eye.

     Again I see the day decline
     Along a ridged horizon line;
     Touching the hill-tops, as a nun
     Her beaded rosary, sinks the sun.
     One lake lies golden, which shall soon
     Be silver in the rising moon;
     And one, the crimson of the skies
     And mountain purple multiplies.

     With the untroubled quiet blends
     The distance-softened voice of friends;
     The girl's light laugh no discord brings
     To the low song the pine-tree sings;
     And, not unwelcome, comes the hail
     Of boyhood from his nearing sail.
     The human presence breaks no spell,
     And sunset still is miracle!

     Calm as the hour, methinks I feel
     A sense of worship o'er me steal;
     Not that of satyr-charming Pan,
     No cult of Nature shaming man,
     Not Beauty's self, but that which lives
     And shines through all the veils it weaves,--
     Soul of the mountain, lake, and wood,
     Their witness to the Eternal Good!

     And if, by fond illusion, here
     The earth to heaven seems drawing near,
     And yon outlying range invites
     To other and serener heights,
     Scarce hid behind its topmost swell,
     The shining Mounts Delectable
     A dream may hint of truth no less
     Than the sharp light of wakefulness.

     As through her vale of incense smoke.
     Of old the spell-rapt priestess spoke,
     More than her heathen oracle,
     May not this trance of sunset tell
     That Nature's forms of loveliness
     Their heavenly archetypes confess,
     Fashioned like Israel's ark alone
     From patterns in the Mount made known?

     A holier beauty overbroods
     These fair and faint similitudes;
     Yet not unblest is he who sees
     Shadows of God's realities,
     And knows beyond this masquerade
     Of shape and color, light and shade,
     And dawn and set, and wax and wane,
     Eternal verities remain.

     O gems of sapphire, granite set!
     O hills that charmed horizons fret
     I know how fair your morns can break,
     In rosy light on isle and lake;
     How over wooded slopes can run
     The noonday play of cloud and sun,
     And evening droop her oriflamme
     Of gold and red in still Asquam.

     The summer moons may round again,
     And careless feet these hills profane;
     These sunsets waste on vacant eyes
     The lavish splendor of the skies;
     Fashion and folly, misplaced here,
     Sigh for their natural atmosphere,
     And travelled pride the outlook scorn
     Of lesser heights than Matterhorn.

     But let me dream that hill and sky
     Of unseen beauty prophesy;
     And in these tinted lakes behold
     The trailing of the raiment fold
     Of that which, still eluding gaze,
     Allures to upward-tending ways,
     Whose footprints make, wherever found,
     Our common earth a holy ground.

," Talk not of sad November, when a day
     Of warm, glad sunshine fills the sky of noon,
     And a wind, borrowed from some morn of June,
     Stirs the brown grasses and the leafless spray.

     On the unfrosted pool the pillared pines
     Lay their long shafts of shadow: the small rill,
     Singing a pleasant song of summer still,
     A line of silver, down the hill-slope shines.

     Hushed the bird-voices and the hum of bees,
     In the thin grass the crickets pipe no more;
     But still the squirrel hoards his winter store,
     And drops his nut-shells from the shag-bark trees.

     Softly the dark green hemlocks whisper: high
     Above, the spires of yellowing larches show,
     Where the woodpecker and home-loving crow
     And jay and nut-hatch winter's threat defy.

     O gracious beauty, ever new and old!
     O sights and sounds of nature, doubly dear
     When the low sunshine warns the closing year
     Of snow-blown fields and waves of Arctic cold!

     Close to my heart I fold each lovely thing
     The sweet day yields; and, not disconsolate,
     With the calm patience of the woods I wait
     For leaf and blossom when God gives us Spring!
