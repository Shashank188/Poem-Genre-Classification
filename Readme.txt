BASIC INFO ABOUT UPLOADS:-
-The dataset contains four categories: WAR,Divine,Love,Nature.
-both py and ipynb files have been uploaded.
-nltk "stopwords" package needs to be downloaded for Stemming.
-sklearn,nltk,numpy and pandas are required.

APPROACH:
-No proper dataset of poem was available directly from the internet, Therefore I built the dataset from scratch with the help of Project Gutenberg.
-I chose books on collections of poems on different themes.Contrasting themes of poems that I choose were Love, Divine, War, Nature.
-High number of Love poem caused data to be baised towards it, therefore it was better if equal number of each class was taken.
-Stemming was better than Lemetization as the later is more vigorous and reduced the efficiency.
- Classifier that I used:Random Forest, Naive Bayes
- Naive Bayes performed better with avg accuracy of 82.5%.
